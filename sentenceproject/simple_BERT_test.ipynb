    "The overall strategy here is going to be to construct pairs of actually-sequential sentences from books of biography and fiction. We'll construct pairs using both dirty and clean texts, making sure the sentences match as closely as possible. For each pair we'll calculate the probability that they're really sequential. Of course they all *are* really sequential, so this probability should be high. But some recent papers have argued that there's a systematic difference here, where transitions seem more probable / predictable in fiction.\n",
