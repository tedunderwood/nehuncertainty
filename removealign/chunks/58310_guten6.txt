 Ten months, indeed, had to pass before he
 could bring his forces together again; but when at last “a great host”
 gathered at Portsmouth once more, ready to sail on Whitsun Eve {May
 27}, 1206,[478] not a voice was raised to oppose its embarkation. The
 year had passed without disturbance in England; nothing had been seen,
 nothing further had even been heard, of the dreaded Flemish and French
 invasion. But on the other side of the sea the delay had told. The fall
 of Loches, shortly after Easter 1205,[479] had been followed on June
 23--scarcely a fortnight after the break-up of the English muster--by
 that of Chinon,[480] and this again by the submission of the viscount
 of Thouars to the French conqueror.[481] Thus the last foothold of the
 Angevins in Touraine and on the northern frontier of Poitou were lost.
 There remained to John only two fortresses on the northern border of
 Poitou--Niort[482] and La Rochelle, the “fair city of the waters,”
 whose natural position made it almost impregnable even in those days,
 whither John had twice sent reinforcements,[483] and whose harbour
 offered a safe and commodious landing-place for him and his troops.
 
 [Sidenote: 1206]
 
 On June 7 John arrived at La Rochelle,[484] and met with an eager
 welcome; the vassals of the duchy of Aquitaine flocked to the standard
 of Eleanor’s heir. Six days after his landing he could venture as far
 into Poitou as the abbey of St. Maixent, half-way between Niort and
 Poitiers. The Poitevin counts had for centuries been benefactors to
 the abbey, and their descendant was no doubt sure of a welcome within
 its walls. He made, however, no further advance northward; it was
 needful, before doing so, to be quite sure of his footing in the south.
 From St. Maixent he went back to Niort, and thence southward through
 Saintonge[485] into Gascony. Here there was known to be a hostile party
 whose leaders had congregated in the castle of Montauban, a mighty
 fortress which Charles the Great was said to have besieged for seven
 years in vain.[486] In the middle of July, John formed the siege of
 Montauban, and then himself withdrew to Bourg-sur-Mer, a little seaport
 at the mouth of the Garonne, while his engines hurled their missiles
 against the fortress, till on the fifteenth day a sufficient breach was
 made, when “the English soldiery, who are specially admirable in this
 work, rushed to scale the walls, and to give and receive intolerable
 blows. At last the Englishmen prevailed, the besieged gave way, and the
 castle was taken.” John had probably come back to direct in person the
 assault thus successfully made by his brave “Englishmen,” for he was
 at Montauban on the day of its capture, August 1.[487] With it there
 fell into his hands, besides horses and arms and countless other spoil,
 a number of prisoners of such importance that we are told he sent a
 list of their names to his justiciars in England.[488] They evidently
 included all the Gascon barons whose hostility he had had reason to
 fear; and with them in his power, he could turn his back upon the south
 without further anxiety.
 
 By August 21 John was back at Niort; after spending a week
 there, he proceeded to Montmorillon, on the borders of Poitou and
 Berry.[489] At this critical moment Almeric of Thouars reverted to
 his old allegiance.[490] John at once struck right across Poitou to
 Clisson,[491] on the borders of Anjou and Britanny; Almeric joined
 him either there or on the way thither, and they marched together
 into Anjou. A chronicler writing in the abbey of S. Aubin at Angers,
 which had always been under the special patronage and protection of
 John’s ancestors, tells how “when the king came to the river Loire, he
 found no boats for crossing. Therefore, on the Wednesday before the
 Nativity of the Blessed Mary {Sept. 6}, coming to the Port Alaschert,
 and making the sign of the cross over the water with his hand, he,
 relying on Divine aid, forded the river with all his host; which is
 a marvellous thing to tell, and such as was never heard of in our
 time.” With fire and sword the host fought its way into Angers, and
 for a whole week the heir of Fulk the Red held his court in the home
 of his forefathers.[492] He then marched up to Le Lude, on the border
 of Maine. On September 20 he was at Angers again, but left it next
 day.[493] On the two following days he was at Coudray, a few miles
 south of Saumur; there, probably, he and Almeric divided their forces,
 Almeric moving westward through his own land to attack Britanny,[494]
 while John seems to have gone southward again.[495] On October 3 he
 was at Thouars, where he stayed a week,[496] perhaps to await Almeric’s
 return.
 
 Meanwhile, however, Philip Augustus had assembled the host of France,
 and led it as far as the Poitevin border.[497] With Philip’s personal
 appearance on the scene of action, John knew that his own successes
 were at an end. Neither Almeric of Thouars, nor the many barons in the
 English host who had taken the oath of allegiance to Philip, would
 fight against that monarch in person. While John went on to secure
 his retreat over sea by another visit to Niort and La Rochelle,[498]
 therefore, negotiations were set on foot; and when he came back to
 Thouars once more, on October 26, it was to proclaim a truce which had
 been made between himself and Philip, to last from October 13 for two
 years. By its terms each sovereign was to retain during that period
 the homage and services of all those who had attached themselves to
 him during the recent war; and any disputes which might arise about
 the allegiance of such persons were to be decided by the judgement of
 four barons named, two to represent each of the kings.[499] Trade, and
 intercourse of every kind, between the dominions of John and Philip
 was to be free, save that no man, unless he were either a priest or
 a “known merchant,” might go to the court of either without special
 licence, if he were a subject of the other. Thirteen sureties swore
 to the truce on behalf of John, and thirteen on behalf of Philip, who
 further undertook that it should be kept by four other barons whose
 oaths John had wished to have on his side, but had apparently been
 unable to obtain.[500] Philip’s sureties were headed by “the count of
 Britanny,” a title which can only represent Constance’s widower, Guy
 of Thouars, and thus shows that Arthur’s death was now, at any rate,
 regarded as certain. The first of John’s sureties was Guy’s brother,
 Almeric, the viscount of Thouars, whose action had for several years
 past generally turned the scale between the rival sovereigns in Poitou,
 and who by the terms of the truce was pledged to his present allegiance
 for the next two years at least. The other sureties on both sides were
 nearly all of them barons of Aquitaine;[501] those of the Angevin
 counties seem for the most part to have stood aloof. It is clear,
 however, that John had secured a firm hold on the southern provinces,
 and to a considerable extent regained a hold upon Poitou. On the whole,
 therefore, his expedition had been successful. The best proof of its
 success lies in Philip’s readiness to accept such a truce, without
 making any attempt to regain the ground which he had lost in Poitou,
 though he was actually in the land with an army at his back. As for
 John, he was going home to his island realm to prepare for a fight of
 another kind, and with an adversary of a character very different from
 that of Philip Augustus.

 [269] That the famous speech put into the mouth of Archbishop Hubert by
 Matthew Paris (_Chron. Maj._ vol. ii. pp. 454, 455) is _not_ noted by
 contemporary writers does not indeed prove that it was never delivered,
 but does indicate that, if delivered, it had for contemporary ears no
 such significance as has been given to it by some modern writers, or as
 Matthew himself appears to have attached to it. Some such address may
 have been made to the assembly by the archbishop before the coronation;
 but if so, it was evidently regarded at the time as a part of the
 formalities usual on the occasion, not remarkable enough to be worth
 recording. In Matthew’s own MS. the passage is a marginal addition; and
 in the form in which he gives it, I can only regard it as the first of
 the many unauthenticated interpolations into the plain text of Roger of
 Wendover with which Matthew has confused for later students the history
 of the reign of John.

 [396] _Hist. de G. le Mar._ vv. 12585–662. The writer appears to date
 this affair in autumn 1202; and the _Itinerary_, a. 4, shows that John
 did in fact go from Alençon to Le Mans on October 29, 1202. But the
 rest of the story is irreconcileable with John’s subsequent movements.
 The only documentary evidence which I have found as to the date of
 Count Robert’s treason is unluckily not decisive; it is a charter of
 John, given “apud Beccum, xx die Aprilis anno regni nostri quarto,
 quo comes Robertus Sagiensis fecit nobis proditionem apud Alenconem”
 (Round, _Cal. Doc. France_, vol. i. p. 131). John in the fourth year
 of his reign made three visits to Alençon besides the one already
 mentioned; viz. one on December 7, 1202, and two in January 1203. The
 first of these two January visits is probably the one recorded by the
 Marshal’s biographer. John was at Alençon January 15–19, at Le Mans
 January 21–23, and at Alençon again January 25 (_Itin._ a. 4). The
 Marshal’s biographer indeed asserts that the king on his return from Le
 Mans
 
   “Ne s’en vint pas par Alençon;
   N’i passast unques sanz tençon
   Anceis qu’il venist en sa terre;
   Aileors ala passage quere;
   Par Mamerz et par Belesmeis
   S’en vint en sa terre li reis” (vv. 12657–62).
 
 It seems, however, possible to reconcile this with the dates as given
 in the _Itinerary_ by supposing that, as he had an escort of “granz
 gens e rotiers,” he may have ventured close up to Alençon, perhaps
 with an idea of surprising it, but turned away again immediately. The
 _Itinerary_ shows him at Séez on January 25–28, at Argentan on 28–30,
 and at Falaise 30–31.

 ignorant on the point six months later still.
 
 [404] Thus in March he received the liege homage of Maurice of Craon
 “for the time of Arthur’s imprisonment”; should Arthur be released
 and adhere to his engagements with Philip, Maurice was to be Arthur’s
 liegeman as he had been of old; should Arthur break faith with Philip,
 then Maurice was to adhere to the latter; should Arthur die, then
 Maurice was to remain a liegeman of Philip. In like manner the castles
 of Brissac and Chemillé were in the following October granted by Philip
 to Guy of Thouars, “saving the rights of Arthur if he be still alive,”

 represent anything else than “Berchères” or “Bercières” (Sir T. D.

 probably one of two places now called Saint-Amand, in the Angoumois.

 CHAPTER IV
 
 KING JOHN
 
 1206–1210
 
   Sed processu temporis mollities illa in tantam crudelitatem
   versa est, ut nulli praedecessorum suorum coaequari valeret, ut in
   sequentibus patebit.
 
               GERV. CANT. ii. 93.
 
 
 [Sidenote: 1205]
 
 The first business wherein John had an opportunity of exercising the
 free kingship which he had, as he said, acquired by the death of Hubert
 Walter, was the appointment of Hubert’s successor. Immediately after
 Hubert’s funeral the king spent six days at Canterbury.[502] He “talked
 much and graciously with the monks” of Christ Church about the choice
 of a new archbishop, and even hinted that one might be found in their
 own ranks. At the same time, however, he took possession of a valuable
 set of church plate bequeathed by Hubert to his cathedral;[503] and
 before leaving Canterbury he issued orders that the election of the
 primate should be made on November 30 by the monks and the bishops of
 the province conjointly.[504] A party in the chapter at once resolved
 to vindicate its independence both against the bishops, whose claim
 to share in the choice of their metropolitan was always opposed by
 the monks, and against the king, whose prerogative of designating the
 candidate to be chosen was in theory regarded by monks and bishops
 alike as uncanonical, though in practice they had been compelled to
 submit to it at every vacancy for a hundred years past at the least.
 The younger and more hot-headed members of the chapter privately
 elected their sub-prior Reginald, enthroned him at dead of night, and
 hurried him off to seek confirmation from the Pope, pledging him to
 secrecy till the confirmation should be secured.[505] The older and
 more prudent brethren evidently connived at these proceedings without
 taking part in them. Their policy was to consent to Reginald’s election
 after the fact, if the Pope’s sanction of it could be obtained; but if
 this were refused, they could repudiate the election as a matter in
 which they had had no share. The convent was, however, unlucky in its
 choice of a champion. Reginald was no sooner across the sea than he
 began to announce himself publicly as “the elect of Canterbury,” and
 even to show the credentials which he had received from his brethren
 for the Pope. Of course this news soon reached England, and caused a
 great commotion in high places there. The bishops, indignant at being
 tricked out of their share in the election, despatched an appeal to
 Rome. The monks sent a counter-appeal;[506] but to them the wrath
 of the king was far more terrible than the wrath of the bishops, or
 even the possible wrath of the Pope. Long before the appeals could be
 decided, they sent to John a deputation charged with a communication
 containing no allusion whatever to Reginald, but simply requesting
 that the convent might be permitted to choose for itself a pastor.
 John received the deputies graciously and assented to their request;
 then, taking them aside, he “pointed out to them that the bishop of
 Norwich” (John de Grey) “was attached to him by a great intimacy,
 and the only one among the prelates of England who knew his private
 affairs,” wherefore it would be greatly for the advantage of king and
 kingdom if he became archbishop--a consummation which the king begged
 the deputies would do their utmost to secure. He sent back with them
 some confidential clerks of his own to assist them in this task, and
 dismissed them with a promise of bestowing great honour on their
 convent if it were accommodating in this matter. The result was an
 unanimous election of John de Grey by the chapter of Christ Church.[507]
 
 [Sidenote: 1206]
 
 On December 6 the king obtained from both bishops and monks a
 withdrawal of their respective appeals.[508] On December 11 John de
 Grey was enthroned at Canterbury in the king’s presence, and invested
 by him with the temporalities of the See; and on the 18th the king
 despatched a messenger to ask for the papal confirmation of the new
 primate’s appointment.[509] The Pope, however, at the end of March
 1206, decided that the election of John de Grey was uncanonical;
 on the validity of Reginald’s election he suspended his judgement,
 ordering the Canterbury chapter to send sixteen of their number to
 him by October 1, with full powers to act on behalf of all, and if
 necessary to hold a new election in his court. The suffragans of the
 province were desired to send proctors, and the king was invited to
 do the like.[510] The king sent three proctors;[511] the bishops seem
 to have contented themselves with writing a joint letter, of whose
 contents we know nothing, except that they had the royal approval.[512]
 Of the sixteen monks who went as representatives of the chapter,
 twelve, before they sailed, secretly exchanged a promise with the
 king. He pledged himself to ratify whatever they should do at Rome;
 they pledged themselves to do nothing there except re-elect John de
 Grey.[513] The assembly at Rome, originally appointed for October 1,
 was postponed till the last week of Advent (December 17 to 24). Then,
 in full consistory, the Pope, after examination, set aside the claim
 of the bishops to a voice in the election, and declared the monks to
 be the sole rightful electors; but he also set aside, as informal and
 void, their election of their sub-prior, Reginald; and he bade them
 elect, then and there, “whomsoever they would, so he were but an
 earnest and capable man, and above all, an Englishman.” All eyes must
 have turned instinctively upon the English-born Cardinal-priest of S.
 Chrysogonus, the most illustrious teacher of theology in his day, “than
 whom there was no man greater in the Roman court, nor was there any
 equal to him in character and learning”--Stephen Langton. Innocent was
 but speaking the thought of the whole assembly when he added that the
 monks could not do better than choose Stephen. The unlucky twelve were
 as willing to do so as the other four, but felt tied by their compact
 with the king. After some shuffling, they confessed their difficulty
 to the Pope. He scornfully absolved them from their shameful promise,
 and the sixteen monks unanimously elected Stephen Langton. The king’s
 proctors, however, refused to ratify the election in John’s name; so
 Innocent at once wrote to request a formal ratification of it from John
 himself.[514]
 
 These things were done in the week following John’s return from La
 Rochelle to England, which took place on December 12.[515] His recent
 experiences had shown him that the recovery of his lost territories was
 by no means impossible, but that it could not, under existing political
 and social conditions, be achieved by means of the only forces which
 the military organization of his own realm could supply. Those forces
 must be supplemented, if not superseded, in any attempt at the
 reconquest of the Norman and Angevin dominions, by the employment of
 mercenaries on a large scale, and by an elaborate system of diplomacy,
 the gradual knitting together of a complicated scheme of foreign
 alliances. For both these purposes the first need was money; and the
 difficulties with which the king had to contend in his efforts to raise
 money were as much greater in John’s case than in that of any of his
 predecessors, as his need was greater than theirs had ever been.
 
 [Sidenote: 1194–1207]
 
 The financial difficulties of the Crown had been accumulating ever
 since Richard’s captivity. At John’s accession the arrears of taxes
 were enormous. At Michaelmas 1201 arrears of all the three “scutages of
 Normandy” imposed under Richard--in 1194, 1195 and 1196--were due from
 almost every shire; hidage “for the king’s ransom” was still owing from
 Dorset and Somerset, and there were many arrears even of the “scutage
 of Wales,” which dated from 1190.[516] Some of these debts ran on as
 late as 1207, and some much later still. The king’s claim to these
 unpaid taxes, as well as to all other debts owed to his predecessor,
 was, of course, never withdrawn. A grotesque instance of the way in
 which the principle of inheritance might sometimes work in such matters
 occurs in the treasury roll of 1201, where two men in Devon are set
 down as owing a fine “because they had been with Count John”[517]--that
 is, because they had supported, in his rebellion against Richard in
 1193, the very man for whom, as king, the fine was now claimed. The
 Crown had, however, no direct means of enforcing payment of either
 fines or taxes, at any rate in the case of the barons. Its one remedy
 was to seize the lands or castles of an obstinate and wilful defaulter;
 and this remedy was fraught with danger to the crown itself. Neither
 law nor custom defined the circumstances or fixed the limits of time
 within which a defaulter was not, and beyond which he was, liable to be
 treated as obstinate and wilful; in every case where the king exercised
 his right of seizure on this ground, therefore, the defaulter and
 his friends could always find a plea for denouncing its exercise as
 arbitrary and unjust.
