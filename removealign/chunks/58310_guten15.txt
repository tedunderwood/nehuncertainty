 Guthlac was
 a blackened desert[1282]--whether its details be literally exact or
 not, pictures vividly the mood of the tyrant. It is little wonder
 that when the tidings of his advance reached Lincoln {Sept. 22},
 Gilbert and his men “fled before his face, dreading his presence like
 lightning.”[1283] They probably fled into the Isle of Axholme, for
 from Lincoln John went by way of Barton[1284] and Scotter to Stowe,
 where he stayed three days {Sept. 26–28}, and whence he appears to have
 sent his mercenaries across the Trent to ravage the Isle with fire and
 sword. He returned to Lincoln on the 28th, to find that Alexander had
 spent two or three days there in his absence,[1285] and had slipped
 past him into Yorkshire. John, however, was less eager for the capture
 of “the little sandy fox” than for vengeance upon the English rebels.
 From Lincoln northward to Grimsby, and thence south again to Spalding,
 the Lincolnshire fields--now, at the beginning of October, all white
 to harvest[1286]--were given to the flames, and the houses and
 farm-buildings sacked and destroyed by the terrible host with the king
 at its head.[1287] On October 9 he appeared before Lynn;[1288] here the
 townsfolk, like most of their class throughout England, were on his
 side, and they gave him not only a joyous welcome, but a substantial
 contribution in money.[1289] He committed the custody of the town
 and the duty of fortifying it to Savaric de Mauléon,[1290] whom on
 September 30 he had sent back to Crowland to “seek out and capture the
 knights and men-at-arms, enemies of the king, who were hiding in secret
 places” among the fens around the monastery. Savaric had “failed to
 find those whom he sought”; but he had dragged some fugitives out of
 sanctuary in the abbey, and brought back a valuable spoil of flocks and
 herds to his master at Lynn.[1291]
 
 Louis had now been besieging Dover for more than two months, and had
 made no progress at all. The strength of the castle, the skill and
 valour of Hubert de Burgh and the hundred and forty knights who, with
 the usual complement of men-at-arms, constituted its garrison, were
 more than a match for all his forces. He swore that he would not
 quit the place till he had hanged every man within its walls;[1292]
 but even the fall of one of its towers seemed to have brought him no
 nearer to effecting an entrance.[1293] He could only turn the siege
 into a blockade, and wait till starvation should accomplish the work
 in which battery and assault had failed. In the country at large he
 was distinctly losing ground. Throughout the summer he had been set
 at nought in Sussex by a young Flemish adventurer called William
 of Casinghem, who, “scorning to do him homage, gathered together a
 thousand bowmen, lodged in the wilderness and woods with which that
 country abounded, and gave the French great trouble all through the
 time of war, slaying many thousands of them.”[1294] On September 2
 John wrote a letter of encouragement to an association extending
 through Sussex, Kent, Surrey and Hampshire, composed of persons whom
 he describes as “sworn and confederate together for fealty and service
 to ourself,” although they had been compelled against their will to
 swear allegiance to his rival. The “barons”--that is, the citizens--of
 Hastings, Sandwich, Dover, Hythe, Romney, Winchelsea, Rye, Pevensey,
 Shoreham and Portsmouth, who had also, under compulsion, taken the
 oath to Louis, had likewise assured John of their devotion to himself,
 and were in return assured of his favour; while the men of Seaford
 had resisted all the pressure put upon them by their lord, Gilbert de
 Laigle, to forsake their allegiance, and were on September 3 warmly
 thanked by John for their loyalty.[1295] Soon after the beginning of
 the siege of Dover Louis was joined from over sea by the count of
 Perche, and in September or October by Peter of Britanny; the arrival
 of this last, however, brought no real gain, for as soon as Peter
 reached England, his brother, Robert of Dreux, returned to France.
 Louis’s English partizans, too, were falling away. Earl William of
 Albemarle offered his repentance and his services to John, who of
 course “forgave him most kindly.”[1296] Of yet greater importance was
 the return to allegiance of William of Salisbury; it was he who, in
 conjunction with Falkes de Bréauté, captured or put to flight a body of
 Louis’s adherents who were besieging Exeter.[1297] At last, however, a
 gleam of light fell across the gloomy prospects of the French party.
 Towards the middle of October Hubert de Burgh and his lieutenant,
 Gerard de Sotinghem, felt that they could not hold out much longer, and
 asked for a truce, that they might send to John either for succour, or
 for leave to surrender the castle. The truce was granted, and on the
 14th the siege of Dover was suspended.[1298]
 
 The crisis had come; it had, however, really come not on the cliffs of
 Kent, but on the shores of the Wash. Sumptuously entertained by the
 burghers of Lynn, John, who--unlike most of his race--was a notorious
 glutton, feasted till his excesses brought on a violent attack of
 dysentery[1299] which he himself seems to have recognized as the
 beginning of the end. One of the latest entries on the Patent Rolls of
 his reign is probably significant of the remorse awakened in him, for
 one at least of his many crimes, by the terror of approaching death; on
 October 10 he granted to Margaret, wife of Walter de Lacy, some land in
 the royal forest of Acornbury, that she might build thereon a religious
 house for the souls of her father, mother and brother[1300]--William,
 Maud and the younger William de Braose. He could not rest; ill as he
 was, he moved next day {Oct. 11} from Lynn to Wisbeach; and early on
 the following morning {Oct. 12} he set out again. “Like a swiftly
 advancing storm,” before which all men fled, he swept northward to the
 mouth of the Welland, and thence in his impatience set out to cross the
 Wash without waiting either for the ebb of the tide or for any one who
 knew the way to guide him across the treacherous soil, covered as it
 was with brackish water. Suddenly the whole host, while struggling with
 the waves, felt the ground opening beneath its feet. The king himself
 and a part of his troops with difficulty reached the further shore;
 the rest of his followers and the whole of his baggage train, with all
 his treasure and his lately gathered spoils, men, horses, arms, tents,
 provisions, “everything in the world that he held most dear, short of
 his own life,” went down into the quicksand.[1301] When at night he
 reached Swineshead abbey, rage and grief threw him into a fever, which
 he aggravated by supping greedily on peaches and new cider.[1302] With
 great difficulty he made his way on the 14th to Sleaford.[1303] There
 he was found, probably on the 15th, by the messengers whom Hubert de
 Burgh had sent from Dover to seek him. Their tidings brought on a
 fresh access of fever, which bleeding failed to relieve.[1304] Nothing
 could check his restlessness; that night or next morning {Oct. 15–16}
 he set out for Newark, and in spite of grievous bodily suffering,
 he set out on horseback. He had, however, ridden only three or four
 miles, “panting and groaning,” when increasing sickness compelled him
 to dismount, and he bade his followers make him a litter in which he
 might travel more easily. There was no workman to make it, and nothing
 to make it of; all that his men could do was to cut down with their
 swords and knives the willows by the roadside, weave them together
 as best they might, and throw a horse-cloth over them. This litter,
 without cushions or even straw to relieve its hardness, had for want
 of carriage-horses to be either slung between some of the high-mettled
 destriers of the knights, or carried on the shoulders of the men. Its
 shaking and jolting soon proved intolerable: “This accursed litter has
 broken all my bones, and well-nigh killed me,” cried the king in an
 agony of pain and rage. Matthew Paris quotes a French rime concerning
 the sons of Henry II. which thus foretold their fate: “Henry, the
 fairest, shall die at Martel; Richard, the Poitevin, shall die in the
 Limousin; John shall die, a landless king, in a litter.” The prediction
 was all but fulfilled; John, however, gathered up strength and spirit
 enough to avoid a literal fulfilment of its closing words, and to ride
 “on an ambling nag” into Newark.[1305]
 
 For three days {Oct. 16–18}, in the bishop of Lincoln’s castle
 whose ruins still look down upon the Trent, the king lay dying. The
 abbot of Croxton, who was skilled in medicine, attended him as his
 physician,[1306] and also ministered to his soul, for he persuaded
 him to confess his sins and receive the Holy Communion.[1307] Then
 the one natural affection traceable in John’s character broke out in
 anxiety for his two little sons, especially for the elder of them, to
 whom the crown must devolve. He solemnly declared Henry his heir, made
 those around him take an oath of fealty to the boy, and sent letters
 to the sheriffs and the constables of the royal castles, bidding them
 look to him as their lord.[1308] He had already, on October 15, before
 leaving Sleaford, dictated a letter entreating for Henry the special
 protection of the Pope.[1309] He now appointed Peter de Mauley guardian
 of his younger son Richard, whom he had apparently left under Peter’s
 charge in Corfe castle. There was but one man in England to whom he
 could confidently entrust the guardianship of the heir to the throne.
 “Before he died, he sent word to William the Marshal, the earl of
 Pembroke, that he placed his eldest son, Henry, in God’s keeping and
 his, and besought him for God’s sake that he would take thought for
 Henry’s interest.”[1310]
 
 The abbot of Croxton then asked the king where he wished to be buried.
 “I commend my body and my soul to God and to S. Wulfstan” was John’s
 reply.[1311] His last act seems to have been the dictation of the
 fragmentary document which has come down to us as his will. “Being
 overtaken,” he says, “by grievous sickness, and thus incapable of
 making a detailed disposition of all my goods, I commit the ordering
 and disposing of my will to the fidelity and discretion of my faithful
 men whose names are written below, without whose counsel, were they at
 hand, I would not, even if in health, ordain anything; and I ratify
 and confirm whatsoever they shall faithfully ordain and determine
 concerning my goods, for the purposes of making satisfaction to God
 and Holy Church for the wrongs I have done them, sending help to the
 realm of Jerusalem, furnishing support to my sons for the recovery
 and defence of their heritage, rewarding those who have served us
 faithfully, and distributing alms to the poor and to religious houses
 for the salvation of my soul. And I pray that whosoever shall give them
 counsel and assistance herein may receive God’s grace and favour; and
 may he who shall violate the settlement made by them incur the curse
 and wrath of God Almighty and the Blessed Mary and all the saints.
 First, then, I desire that my body be buried in the church of the
 Blessed Mary and S. Wulfstan of Worcester. Now I appoint as ordainers
 and disposers of my will the following persons:--the lord Gualo, by
 God’s grace cardinal priest of the title of S. Martin, legate of
 the Apostolic See; Peter, lord bishop of Winchester; Richard, lord
 bishop of Chichester; Silvester, lord bishop of Worcester; Brother
 Aimeric of Ste. Maure; William the Marshal, earl of Pembroke; Ranulf,
 earl of Chester; William, earl of Ferrars; William Brewer; Walter de
 Lacy; John of Monmouth; Savaric de Mauléon; Falkes de Bréauté.”[1312]
 Here, without date, signature or seal, the so-called will breaks off
 abruptly; evidently the testator had not time to complete it. At
 midnight {Oct. 18–19} a whirlwind swept over Newark with such violence
 that the townsfolk thought their houses would fall, and in that hour
 of elemental disturbance and human terror the king passed away.[1313]
 A monk named John of Savigny, entering the town at daybreak {Oct.
 19}, met the servants of the royal household hurrying out laden with
 everything of their master’s that they could carry. The corpse--for
 which they had not left even a decent covering[1314]--had meanwhile
 been hastily embalmed by the abbot of Croxton; John having, it is said,
 made a grant of his heart, with ten pounds’ worth of land, to Croxton
 abbey.[1315] The abbot, too, fled as soon as his work was done and
 his strange relic secured; it was John of Savigny who, at the request
 of the constable of Newark, kept the last watch beside the body and
 offered his mass that morning for the soul of the dead king.[1316]
 The body was then dressed in such semblance of royal attire as could
 be procured, and the remnant of John’s soldiers--nearly all foreign
 mercenaries--formed themselves into a guard for its protection on the
 journey from Newark to Worcester. The grim funeral train, every man in
 full armour, passed unhindered across England, and John was buried by
 Bishop Silvester in Worcester cathedral according to his desire.[1317]
 
     Within this tomb lies buried a monarch’s outward form,
     Whose inner man’s departure hath stilled war’s raging storm.
 
 Thus may be roughly rendered the opening lines of an epitaph on King
 John preserved by Roger of Wendover.[1318] The poet’s words are true;
 John’s death virtually ended the war. From his burial the Marshal,
 the Legate, and the bishops passed to the crowning of his heir and
 the publication, in the boy-king’s name, of the Great Charter in a
 revised form to which Gualo had no hesitation in giving the papal
 sanction, and which, thus safeguarded, left the revolutionary party no
 excuse for continuing the struggle. Thenceforth it was idle for Louis
 and his adherents to pretend that they were fighting for England’s
 deliverance from bondage; all men could see that they were fighting
 for her enslavement to a foreign conqueror. The majority of the barons
 had already become conscious of the blunder, or worse than blunder,
 which they had committed in calling the stranger to their aid, and
 were ready now to join in a national movement for his expulsion. His
 enterprise was doomed to fail when the kingdom ceased to be divided
 against itself; and the one insuperable obstacle to the healing of
 its divisions was removed in the person of John. It was John whose
 very existence had made peace impossible. “Forasmuch as when he came
 to die he possessed none of his land in peace,” says Matthew Paris,
 “he is called Lackland.”[1319] John had indeed earned for himself in
 a new sense the name which his father had given him at his birth; and
 he had earned it not by blunders in statecraft or errors in strategy,
 not by weakness or cowardice or sloth, but by the almost superhuman
 wickedness of a life which, twenty years before its end, a historian
 of deeper insight than Matthew had characterized in one memorable
 phrase--“Nature’s enemy, John.”

 One party under Hugh de Boves was wrecked in a storm on the Norfolk

 and a large quantity of money also went down; but the survivors made

 quite as sarcastic upon it, as the royalist Roger of Wendover.

 post Ascensionem Domini, scilicet xiiii kalendas Junii.” W. Coventry,
 p. 229, is quite wrong. John had gone on May 19 (Ascension Day) to
 Folkestone; on the 20th and 21st he was at Canterbury. _Itin._ a. 17,

 _Gesta P. A._ c. 221, that John actually did await the attack of the
 French, and was driven away by their vigorous onset, certainly is, as
 M. Petit-Dutaillis says (_Louis VIII._ p. 100), an error. That error is
 grounded, like the sneering comments of Ralf of Coggeshall (p. 181),
 the _Ann. Winton._ (a. 1216), and some later writers, on the mistaken
 idea that John was on the spot when Louis first landed on the 21st.

 and convent of S. Augustine’s, but it was evidently a manifesto of
 which copies were sent, or intended to be sent, to all the religious
 houses of note, probably also to the secular clergy, and perhaps to be
 distributed among the laity as well. The character of Louis’s “case” as
 set forth in this letter, and in the arguments of his envoys at Rome
 (R. Wendover, vol. iii. pp. 371–8), has been sufficiently exposed by M.

 however, we shall see that Salisbury “went back” almost as promptly
 as Albemarle, and the story seems quite unknown to the English
 chroniclers, its truth may be doubted, though the mere fact that such
 a story could be told of John with reference to his own sister-in-law
 illustrates the character for reckless wickedness which he had earned
 for himself.

 travelled with marvellous rapidity.

 this as having occurred on the road from Swineshead to Sleaford, where
 he makes John die; a characteristic piece of confusion, illustrative of
 Matthew’s careless way of reading the author on whose work his own is

 perfectly accurate and perfectly clear.

 and good advice to his heir is evidently intended for the edification
 of Henry III. and of posterity, and if it has any foundation at all,
 it is inserted in a wrong place; for it is put after John’s last
 Communion, whereas the abbot obviously must have insisted upon John’s
 declaring himself to be in charity with all men (the barons, by
 implication at least, included) _before_ he gave him the Sacrament.

 NOTE I
 
 JOHN AND THE DE BRAOSES
 
 
 The fullest account of the quarrel of King John and William de Braose
 is contained in a document printed in _Foedera_, vol. i. pt. i. pp.
 107, 108. This is a letter or manifesto addressed by John, after the
 fall of De Braose, “to all who may read it,” witnessed by the justiciar
 (Geoffrey Fitz-Peter), the earls of Salisbury, Winchester, Clare,
 Hertford, and Ferrars, Robert Fitz-Walter, William Brewer, Hugh de
 Neville, William d’Aubigny, Adam de Port, Hugh de Gournay, William de
 Mowbray “and others,” and evidently intended as a public defence of
 the king’s conduct towards William. Coming from John, and under such
 circumstances, its truthfulness is necessarily open to suspicion;
 but it is hardly conceivable that so many witnesses of such rank and
 character as those enumerated should have set their hands to it if it
 contained any gross misrepresentations of matters which must have been
 well known to most of them; one of these witnesses, indeed, the earl of
 Ferrars, is stated in the letter itself to have been De Braose’s own
 nephew, and another, Adam de Port, his brother-in-law. The only point
 on which the letter seems to be at variance with any other contemporary
 authority is the amount of the debt owed by De Braose to the king at
 the end of 1207 or beginning of 1208. John says (_l.c._ p. 107), that
 William then owed him the whole of the 5000 marks due for the honour of
 Limerick, and had only paid him one sum of 100 marks for the ferm of
 the city “which he had held for five years” (strictly speaking, it was,
 at the utmost, four years and a half). The Pipe Rolls of 1206, 1207,
 1208, 1209, and 1210 (8–12 John), however, all state the sum still owed
 by William for the honour of Limerick as £2865: 6: 8 (= 4298 marks),
 thus implying that £468, or 702 marks, had been paid before Michaelmas
 1206. In the Roll of that year the city of Limerick is not mentioned;
 but in each of the later Rolls William is said to owe £80 for its
 tallage, and 100 marks for its ferm for one year (Sweetman, _Calendar_,
 vol. i. pp. 46, 55, 58, 68). This does not necessarily imply that the
 ferm for the other years had not been paid; for the original grant of
 the custody of the city of Limerick to De Braose in July 1203 and the
 writ ordering its restoration to him in August 1205 both specify that
 he is to pay its ferm “to our exchequer _in Dublin_” (_Rot. Chart._ p.
 107 b; _Rot. Claus._ vol. i. p. 47). As there are no remaining records
 of the Dublin Exchequer of so early a date, we cannot certainly know
 what was or was not paid in there. The strange thing is not that the
 English Exchequer should claim only one year’s ferm for Limerick, but
 that it should have any claim at all in the matter. The restoration of
 the city to De Braose in August 1205 was ordered to be conditional on
 his finding security, within forty days, for the payment of the arrears
 of the ferm. That the restoration was actually made, and therefore that
 he gave the security, is plain; but there is nothing to show that he
 ever redeemed his pledge, or that he paid the ferm for the succeeding
 years.
 
 The story of John’s vengeance on the family of De Braose appears,
 in slightly varied forms, in almost every chronicle of the period.
 Ralph of Coggeshall (p. 164), Roger of Wendover (vol. iii. p. 235)
 and the _Brut y Tywysogion_ (a. 1209) say the victims were “slain in
 Windsor castle”; the Annals of Dunstable and of Oseney (a. 1210), that
 they “died in prison,” without specifying where or how. The Barnwell
 Annalist (W. Coventry, vol. ii. p. 202) and the Annals of Margan,
 Tewkesbury, Waverley, Winchester, and Worcester (a. 1210) say they were
 starved to death. The _Hist. des Ducs de Normandie_ (pp. 114–115) says
 they were imprisoned “el castiel del Corf,” with no food save “une
 garbe d’avoine e i bacon cru,” and describes with gruesome minuteness
 the attitudes in which, on the eleventh day, they were found dead.
 Ralph of Coggeshall makes the victims William de Braose’s wife and
 “sons” (_filii_); Roger of Wendover, his wife, eldest son, and that
 son’s wife; the _Ann. Winton._, wife and “younger” son; the _Ann.
 Tewkesb._, wife and “children” (_liberi_); while the _Ann. Dunst._
 say: “Cepit [rex] Willelmum de Lacy, et Willelmum de Brause juniorem,
 et sororem ejus, et Matildem matrem ejus; qui in carcere post modum
 perierunt.” All the other writers speak only of the wife and one son,
 whom the _Ann. Osen._ call “Willelmus primogenitus ejus,” and the _Ann.
 Wigorn._ “haeres.” This latter version is undoubtedly the correct one
 as to the last point; of De Braose’s three sons, the eldest, William,
 alone was in John’s power; Giles, the second, was bishop of Hereford
 and safe beyond the sea, while the third, Reginald, had escaped
 capture, and lived to recover the greater part of the family heritage.
 One of the daughters--the wife of Hugh Mortimer--had been taken
 prisoner with her mother and eldest brother (_Foedera_, vol. i. pt. i.
 p. 107); but she did not share their fate, for she was set free in 1214
 (_Rot. Pat._ vol. i. p. 122); and Roger of Wendover is certainly wrong
 about the younger William’s wife, who was still living in July 1220
 (_Royal Letters_, ed. Shirley, vol. i. p. 136). The elder William died,
 an exile in France, about a year after this tragedy (R. Wend. vol. iii.
 p. 237).
 
 
 
 
 NOTE II
 
 EUSTACE DE VESCI AND ROBERT FITZ-WALTER
 
 
 Eustace de Vesci and Robert Fitz-Walter have long figured in history as
 typical examples of the way in which individual barons were goaded into
 hatred and vengeance against John by his invasions of their domestic
 peace, and also as foremost among the “patriots” to whom England is
 supposed to be indebted for her Great Charter. On both aspects of
 the lives of these two men--especially of the life of Fitz-Walter,
 whom Professor Tout has glorified as “the first champion of English
 liberty”--a few considerations may be offered here.
 
 1. The earliest mention of John’s unsuccessful attempt to entrap
 the wife of Eustace de Vesci is in an addition made by a chronicler
 at Furness Abbey, writing c. 1270–1298, to the Stanley chronicler’s
 continuation of the history of William of Newburgh. This Furness writer
 (Howlett, _Chron. of Stephen_, etc., vol. ii. p. 521) merely states the
 bare fact, without any details, in the briefest and simplest way, and
 without any clue to the date. Walter of Hemingburgh, who was living
 in 1313, tells the story in an elaborate form which is certainly not
 impossible, perhaps not even very improbable, although it somewhat
 resembles a story in Procopius (see _Dic. Nat. Biogr._ “Vesci, Eustace
 de”). Walter gives it as an illustration of John’s character, of which
 he inserts a picture--painted in the most frightful colours--between
 the coming of the Franciscans in 1212 and the rising of the barons in
 1215; but he connects the incident directly with the latter event,
 representing Eustace as inducing those of his fellow-barons whom the
 king had injured in a similar way to join him in a common effort for
 vengeance, which widens into the struggle for the Charter (Hemingburgh,
 vol. i. pp. 247–9). The affair would thus seem to have occurred some
 years after Eustace’s desertion from the king’s host and flight from
 England in 1212; a desertion for which, therefore, it cannot serve as
 an excuse.
 
 2. The legend of Robert Fitz-Walter’s daughter which became famous in
 prose and verse in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries is based
 upon a passage in the Chronicle of Dunmow, printed in _Monasticon_,
 vol. vi. pt. i. p. 147. This chronicle, written in a monastery of which
 the Fitz-Walters were patrons, begins with the year 1054, but the MS.
 (Cott. Cleopatra C. iii.) is of the end of the fifteenth century; it
 ends at the year 1501. The story is placed in 1216, and is briefly
 this: John demands Robert’s daughter, the fair maiden Matilda; her
 father refuses to give her up to him; the civil war breaks out, and
 the city of London joins the barons; afterwards they are worsted,
 whereupon the king destroys Robert’s fortress in London--Castle
 Baynard--and causes Matilda to be poisoned at Robert’s manor of Dunmow.
 Meanwhile Robert has fled to France. War continues on both sides of
 the Channel. Presently John goes to France, and has a conference with
 Philip Augustus; Robert Fitz-Walter displays his prowess in a single
 combat in presence of both the kings; John admires his valour, they are
 reconciled, and remain friends from that time forth.
 
 On a tale so monstrous and so nonsensical as this, comment is needless.
 There is, however, a much earlier and more rational account of the
 quarrel between John and Fitz-Walter. According to the contemporary
 _Histoire des Ducs de Normandie_, Robert Fitz-Walter, “qui estoit uns
 des plus haus homes d’Engletierre et uns des plus poissans” (he was
 lord of Dunmow in Essex, of Baynard’s Castle in London, and also, by
 his marriage with an heiress, of large estates in the north), had two
 daughters, of whom the elder was married to Geoffrey de Mandeville,
 eldest son of Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, chief justiciar of England. “Une
 fois” when the king was visiting Marlborough, a quarrel for lodgings
 arose between the servants of this young Geoffrey and those of William
 Brewer; they came to blows, and Brewer’s chief “sergeant” was slain by
 the hand of Geoffrey himself. Geoffrey, fearing the wrath of the king,
 whom he knew to be jealous of his father’s power and wealth, fled to
 his wife’s father, who went to intercede for him with the king; John,
 however, “jura les dens Diu que non auroit (merchi), ains le feroit
 pendre, se il le pooit tenir.” Robert in return swore “Par _Corpus
 Domini_, non ferés! ains en verriés ii. m. hiaumes laciés en vostre
 tierre, que chil fust pendus qui ma fille a.” At last John promised
 a “day” for agreement between himself and Geoffrey at Nottingham,
 intending to seize him at his coming; but Robert, “ki le roi connissoit
 à moult gaignart,” came with his son-in-law, and with five hundred
 knights at his back. The king then proposed another “day,” and the
 same thing happened a second time. Then John began to plot vengeance
 upon Robert; he sent secret orders to “ses bourgois de Londres, qui
 se faisoient apelier baron,” to pull down Castle Baynard; and they,
 not daring to disobey him, did as they were bid. Robert, knowing very
 well that they had acted on an order from the king, fled over sea with
 his wife and children. On reaching the Continent “il fist à entendre
 par tout que li rois Jehans voloit sa fille aisnée, qui feme estoit
 Joffroi de Mandeville, avoir à force à amie, et por chou que il ne le
 vaut soufrir, l’avoit il chacié de sa tierre et tout le sien tolut.”
 This was the tale which he also told to King Philip of France, at
 whose court he--after staying some time at Arras--presented himself
 just as Philip was preparing to invade England. When the invasion had
 been checked by John’s submission to Pandulf and Pandulf’s prohibition
 to Philip, Robert went to “Pandoufle le clerc” and to him told another
 tale: “li dist que il s’estoit partis d’Engletierre por le roi qui
 escumeniiés estoit, car il ne voloit pas estre en la compaignie des
 escumeniiés; et por chou li avoit li rois toute sa terre tolue”;
 wherefore he begged Pandulf, now that the king was excommunicate no
 longer, to make peace for him and get him back his land, which Pandulf
 accordingly did (_Hist. des Ducs_, pp. 115–25).
 
 Here, at any rate, it is clear that the date of the quarrel cannot
 have been later than the spring of 1213; perhaps, as we are not told
 how long Robert stayed in Flanders before going to France, it might be
 some months earlier. This agrees with the date assigned to Robert’s
 flight from England by the Barnwell annalist, Ralph of Coggeshall, and
 Roger of Wendover, all of whom place it in the latter part of 1212
 (see below, p. 292). The cause of the flight, however, still remains
 doubtful. It will be observed that the writer of the _Histoire des
 Ducs_, speaking in his own person, makes the quarrel between John and
 Robert arise out of John’s enmity to Robert’s son-in-law, Geoffrey
 de Mandeville, and also makes that enmity originate in the king’s
 jealousy of Geoffrey’s father (the Justiciar), without a word about
 Geoffrey’s wife; but that he represents Robert Fitz-Walter as having
 given to different persons two different accounts of the matter,
 both of which are quite distinct not only from the account given by
 the writer himself, but also from each other. To the third of these
 three accounts--the assertion which Robert is said to have made to
 Pandulf, that he left England because he would not keep company with
 an excommunicate sovereign--it is hardly possible for any one who has
 read the story of the years of interdict to attach any weight. Robert’s
 appeal to Pandulf, moreover, is chronologically out of place; it is
 represented as having been made after John’s agreement with Pandulf,
 whereas in reality the restoration of Robert Fitz-Walter, and also of
 Eustace de Vesci, was one of the conditions of that agreement. The
 statement which Robert is said to have made “everywhere,” on the other
 hand, is only too likely to be true, and may well contain the true
 explanation of John’s designs against the husband of Fitz-Walter’s
 daughter; while none of the three versions is incompatible with either
 of the others. Still the fact remains that three different versions are
 thus given--two on the alleged authority of Robert Fitz-Walter, one on
 his own authority--by a writer who was strictly contemporary, and who
 ranks as one of the best, and certainly the most impartial, of our
 informants on the closing years of John’s reign; and this fact leaves
 a somewhat sinister impression as to the opinion which that writer,
 at least, entertained of the truthfulness of the “first champion of
 English liberty.”
 
 The main facts which can be gathered from other sources as to Robert
 Fitz-Walter’s relations with the king are these. In 1203 he and
 Saher de Quincy were jointly charged by John with the defence of the
 castle of Vaudreuil. They surrendered the place to Philip Augustus
 under circumstances so exceptionally disgraceful that Philip himself
 felt constrained to make an example of them as cowards and traitors
 of too deep a dye to be left unpunished, and flung them into prison
 at Compiègne, whence they were only released on payment of a heavy
 ransom (R. Wend. iii. 172; R. Coggeshall, pp. 143, 144). “Ex qua re,”
 adds Ralf of Coggeshall, “facti sunt in derisum et in opprobrium omni
 populo utriusque regni, canticum eorum tota die, ac generositatis
 suae maculaverunt gloriam” (cf. _Hist. des Ducs_, p. 97). Alone, the
 sovereign whom they had betrayed sought to shield their reputation at
 the risk of his own. Of course he acted from a motive of self-interest.
 As neither Robert nor Saher held any lands in Normandy, their money was
 to Philip more useful than their personal adhesion could have been. But
 for John the friendship of two barons of such importance in England was
 worth buying back, and he endeavoured to secure it by treating them
 with an exaggerated generosity which was evidently designed to impress
 them by its contrast with Philip’s severity; he issued (July 5, 1203)
 letters patent declaring that they had surrendered Vaudreuil under a
 warrant from himself, and ordering that neither they nor its garrison
 should be made to suffer for their act (_Rot. Pat._ vol. i. p. 31).
 Fitz-Walter therefore came back in peace to his English possessions.
 Like Eustace de Vesci, he joined the host which John gathered for a
 Welsh war in 1212; like Eustace, too, he withdrew from it secretly
 on learning that John had received a warning of treason in its ranks
 (_Ann. Waverl._ a. 1212); and like Eustace, again, he did not come
 when summoned to make his “purgation” with the other barons, but, as
 has been already seen, fled the country instead (W. Coventry, ii. 207;
 R. Coggeshall, p. 165; R. Wendover, iii. 240). The Barnwell annalist
 (W. Coventry, _l.c._) dates the demolition of Castle Baynard, and of
 Robert’s other castles, after his flight; the Annals of Dunstable place
 the destruction of Castle Baynard a year earlier, viz. in 1211.
 
 There remains the question: What was the reason for the special
 mention of Eustace de Vesci and Robert Fitz-Walter in the terms of
 reconciliation between the Pope and John? At first glance it seems
 natural to infer that there must have been some peculiar injustice in
 John’s outlawry of these two men, to make their restoration a matter
 for intervention on the part of the Pope. But, as has been seen, all
 the ascertained facts of the case point the opposite way. If indeed
 Fitz-Walter’s alleged assertion to Pandulf, that he had fled on account
 of the king’s excommunication, were true, he would naturally be among
 the “laicis ad hoc negotium contingentibus” (R. Wendover, iii. 248),
 while the fact that the rest of these lay sufferers seem to have been
 all of lower rank might possibly account for his being specially
 mentioned by name. But it was not true; and with regard to De Vesci no
 such assertion is mentioned. Nevertheless, it is extremely probable
 that both Fitz-Walter and De Vesci may have contrived to represent to
 the Pope or his commissioner the cause of their exile in the way in
 which Fitz-Walter is described as representing his own case to Pandulf;
 and neither Pandulf nor Innocent could have at his command the means of
 knowing what all the evidence now available goes to show--that these
 two men had fled their country and left their property to fall into the
 king’s hand, not for conscience’s sake, but because their consciences
 accused them of treason.
