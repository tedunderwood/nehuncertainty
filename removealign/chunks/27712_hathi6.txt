THINGS went on thus at Humblethwaite for three

eeks, and Sir Harry began to feel that he could

adure it no longer. He had expected to have heard

gain from Mr. Boltby, but no letter had come. Mr.

oltby had suggested to him something of starving

at the town, and he had expected to be informed

efore this whether the town were starved out or not.

Ie had received an indignant and grandiloquent letter

com his cousin, of which as yet he had taken no no-

et he had left Mr. Boltby with a feeling which made

untrue to her, she simply disbelieved it. But what if

he were? His untruth would not justify hers. And

untruth was impossible to her. She loved him, and

had told him so. Let him be ever so false, it was for

her to bring him back to truth or to spend herself in

the endeavour. Her father did not understand her at

all when he talked to her after this fashion. But she

said nothing. Her father was alluding to a matter on

“No, Papa; not groundless, only useless."

“But if there is nothing good?” Sir Harry, as he

said this, remembered the indignant refusal of his

offer which was at that moment in his pocket, and

confessed to himself that he had no right to say that

nothing good could be found in Cousin George.

“Do not say that, Papa. How can you say that

of any one? Remember, he has our name, and he

must some day be at the head of our family."

“It will not be long, first,” said Sir Harry, mourn-

fully.

“Many, many, many years, I hope. For his sake

as well as ours, I pray that it may be so. But still it

is natural to suppose that the day will come.”

"Of course it will come.”

“Must it not be right, then, to make him fit for it

when it comes? It can't be your great duty to think

of him, as it is mine; but still it must be a duty to

you too. I will not excuse his life, Papa; but have

there not been temptations,—such great temptations?

And then, other men are excused for doing what he

has done. Let us try together, Papa. Say that you

will try.”

It was clear to Sir Harry through it all that she

knew nothing as yet of the nature of the man's

offences. When she spoke of temptation not resisted,

she was still thinking of commonplace extravagance,

“We need not quite fix that. I was thinking of

Emily, when her father left her, was aware that she

ot to be expected that she should be allowed to give

was a proposition from an old gentleman, possessed

of enormous wealth, to “pay all Captain Hotspur's

debts.” Three months ago, Mr. Hart would willingly

have sold every scrap of the Captain's paper in his

possession for the half of the sum inscribed on it.

The whole sum was now promised, and would un-

doubtedly be paid if the Captain could be worked

upon to do as Mr. Boltby desired. But if the gentle-

men employed on this delicate business were to blow

upon the Captain too severely, Mr. Boltby would have

no such absolute necessity to purchase the Captain.

The Captain would sink to zero, and not need

purchasing. Mr. Walker must have back his money,

--or so much of it as Mr. Hart might permit him to

take. That probably might be managed; and the

Captain must be thoroughly frightened, and must be

made to write the letter which Mr. Boltby desired.

Mr. Hart understood his work very well;—so, it is

hoped, does the reader.

Captain Stubber was in these days a thorn in our

hero's side; but Mr. Hart was a scourge of scorpions.

Mr. Hart never ceased to talk of Mr. Walker, and of

the determination of Walker and Bullbean to go before

a magistrate if restitution were not made. Cousin

George of course denied the foul play, but admitted

that he would repay the money if he had it. There

should be no difficulty about the money, Mr. Hart

d then George found himself in a small parlour, or

ok-room, or subsidiary library, which he had very

sely known to be used. But there was a fire in the

om, and he stood before it, twiddling his hat.

In a quarter of an hour the door was opened, and

ne servant came in with a tray and wine and sand-

Fiches. George felt it to be an inappropriate wel-

ome; but still, after a fashion, it was a welcome.

"Is Sir Harry in the house?” he asked.

“Yes, Mr. Hotspur.”

“Does he know that I am here?”

“Yes, Mr. Hotspur, I think he does."

Then it occurred to Cousin George that perhaps

ne might bribe the servant; and he put his hand into

his pocket. But before he had communicated the two

half-crowns, it struck him that there was no possible

equest which he could make to the man in reference

:o which a bribe would be serviceable.

“Just ask them to look to the horses," he said;

'I don't know whether they were taken out."

“The horses is feeding, Mr. Hotspur,” said the

Every word the man spoke was gravely spoken,

CHAPTER XIX.

The new Smithy.

SIR HARRY was sitting alone in the library when

the tidings were brought to him that George Hotspur

had reached Humblethwaite with a pair of post-horses

from Penrith. The old butler, Cloudesdale, brought

him the news, and Cloudesdale whispered it into his

ears with solemn sorrow. Cloudesdale was well aware

that Cousin George was no credit to the house of

Humblethwaite. And much about the same time the

information was brought to Lady Elizabeth by her

housekeeper, and to Emily by her own maid. It was

by Cloudesdale's orders that George was shown into

the small room near the hall; and he told Şir Harry

what he had done in a funereal whisper. Lady

Altringham had been quite right in her method of

ensuring the general delivery of the information about

he house.

Emily flew at once to her mother. “George is

here,” she said. Mrs. Quick, the housekeeper, was at

aid Sir Harry. That was all very well, but as Emily's

vants in this respect were at variance with her father's,

here was a difficulty. Lady Elizabeth pleaded that

ome kind of civility, at least some mitigation of op-

osition, should be shown, for Emily's sake. At last

he was commissioned to go to Cousin George, to

end him away from the house, and, if necessary, to

nake an appointment between him and Sir Harry at

he Crown, at Penrith, for the morrow. Nothing on

arth should induce Sir Harry to see his cousin any-

vhere on his own premises. As for any meeting be-

ween Cousin George and Emily, that was, of course,

out of the question,-and he must go from Hum-

olethwaite. Such were the instructions with which

Lady Elizabeth descended to the little room. ,

Cousin George came forward with the pleasantest

-mile to take. Lady Elizabeth by the hand. He was

considerably relieved when he saw Lady Elizabeth,

because of her he was not afraid. “I do not at all

“Quite well.”

“And yourself?”

“Pretty well, thank you.”

need be no further talk about it, as any such inter-

view was at present quite impossible. By all which

arguments and refusals, and the tone in which they

were pronounced, Cousin George was taught to per-

ceive that, at any rate in the nuind of Lady Eliza-

beth, the process of parental yielding had already

commenced.

On all such occasions interviews are bad. The

teller of this story ventures to take the opportunity of

recommending parents in such cases always to refuse

interviews, not only between the young lady and the

lover who is to be excluded, but also between them-

selves and the lover. The vacillating tone,-even

when the resolve to suppress vacillation has been most

determined, -is perceived and understood, and at once

utilized, by the least argumentative of lovers, even by

lovers who are obtuse. The word "never" may be so

pronounced as to make the young lady's twenty thou-

sand pounds full present value for ten in the lover's

pocket. There should be no arguments, no letters, no

interviews; and the young lady's love should be starved

by the absence of all other mention of the name, and

by the imperturbable good humour on all other matters

of those with whom she comes in contact in her own

domestic circle. If it be worth anything, it won't be

starved; but if starving to death be possible, that is

the way to starve it. Lady Elizabeth was a bad am-
