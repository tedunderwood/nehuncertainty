The very sensible and, as one would have thought,

-ery manifest idea of buying up Cousin George

originated with Mr. Boltby. “He will have his price,

Sir Harry,” said the lawyer. Then Sir Harry's eyes

were opened, and so excellent did this mode of escape

seem to him that he was ready to pay almost any price

For the article. He saw it at a glance. Emily had

nigh-flown notions, and would not yield; he feared

that she would not yield, let Cousin George's delin-

quencies be shown to be as black as Styx. But if

Cousin George could be made to give her up,—then

Emily must yield; and, yielding in such manner,

having received so rude a proof of her lover's un-

worthiness, it could not be but that her heart would

be changed. Sir Harry's first idea of a price was very

noble; all debts to be paid, a thousand a year for the

present, and Scarrowby to be attached to the title. What

price would be too high to pay for the extrication of

his daughter from so grievous a misfortune? But Mr.

Boltby was more calm. As to the payment of the

debts, yes, within a certain liberal limit. For the

clearly against it. “He would raise every shilling h

the offer was made in the terms with which the reade

is already acquainted. George was sent off from th

lawyer's chambers with directions to consider the terms

for perpetuating the irritation on the young man which

Hart and Stubber together were able to produce. Th

young man should be made to understand that hungr

certain conditions, could become very hungry indeed

George Hotspur, blackguard and worthless as he

was, did not at first realize the fact that Sir Harry

and Mr. Boltby were endeavouring to buy him. He

was asked to give up his cousin, and he was told that

if he did so a certain very generous amount of pecu-

niary assistance should be given to him; but yet he

did not at the first glance perceive that one was to be

the price of the other,--that if he took the one he

Sir Harry would of course be bound to do something

or the title. As for living abroad,-he might promise

hat, but they could not make him keep his promise.

He would not dislike to travel for six months, on con-

Hition that he should be well provided with ready

money. There was much that was alluring in the

Offer, and he began to think whether he could not get

Et all without actually abandoning his cousin. But

Then he was to give a written pledge to that effect,

which, if given, no doubt would be shown to her.

No; that would not do. Emily was his prize; and

though he did not value her at her worth, not under-

standing such worth, still he had an idea that she

would be true to him. Then at last came upon him

an understanding of the fact, and he perceived that a

bribe had been offered to him.

For half a day he was so disgusted at the idea that

his virtue was rampant within him. Sell his Emily for

money? Never! His Emily, and all her rich pro-

spects, and that for a sum so inadequate! They little

knew their man when they made a proposition so vile!

That evening, at his club, he wrote a letter to Sir

Harry, and the letter as soon as written was put into

But before he could get out of his hotel a visitor

as upon him. Mr. Hart desired to see him. At this

coment he would almost have preferred to see Captain

Eubber. He remembered at the moment that Mr.

Cart was acquainted with Mr. Walker, and that Mr.

Jalker would probably have sought the society of Mr.

Hart after a late occurrence in which he, Cousin George,

ad taken part. He was going across to breakfast at

Lis club, when he found himself almost forced to

ccompany Mr. Hart into a little private room at the

eft hand of the hall of the hotel. He wanted his

le had usually found Mr. Hart to be an enduring

ian, not irascible, though very pertinacious, and

ometimes almost good-natured. For a moment he

hought he would bully Mr. Hart, but when he looked

ito Mr. Hart's face, his heart misgave him. “This

a most inconvenient time--" he had begun. But

CHAPTER XVI.

Sir Harry's Return.

SIR HARRY received the grandly worded and in-

dignant letter which had been written at the club,

and Cousin George hesitated as to that other letter

which his friend was to dictate for him. Conse-

quently it became necessary that Sir Harry should

leave London before the matter was settled. In

truth the old Baronet liked the grandly worded and

Endignant letter. It was almost such a letter as a

Hotspur should write on such an occasion. There

was an admission of pecuniary weakness which did

not quite become a Hotspur, but otherwise the letter

was a good letter. Before he left London he took the

letter with him to Mr. Boltby, and on his way thither

could not refrain from counting up all the good things

which would befall him and his if only this young

man might be reclaimed and recast in a mould such

as should fit the heir of the Hotspurs. He had been

very bad, --so bad that when Sir Harry counted up

his sins they seemed to be as black as night. And

then, as he thought of them, the father would declare

to himself that he would not imperil his daughter by

trusting her to one who had shown himself to be so

evil. But agair

o the matter, and not being afraid of Sir Harry, he

determined to speak his mind freely:

“Sir Harry,” he said, “in this matter I must tell

you what I really think.”

“Certainly."

“I am sorry to have to speak ill of one bearing

your name; and were not the matter urgent' as it is,

I should probably repress something of my opinion.

As it is, I do not dare to do so. You could not in

all London find a man less fit to be the husband of

Miss Hotspur than her cousin."

“He is a gentleman-by birth,” said Sir Harry.

“He is an unprincipled blackguard by education,

and the more blackguard because of his birth; there is

nothing too bad for him to do, and very little so bad

but what he has done it. He is a gambler, a swindler,

and, as I believe, a forger and a card-sharper. He has

lived upon the wages of the woman he has professed

to love. He has shown himself to be utterly spiritless,

abominable, and vile. If my clerk in the next room

were to slap his face, I do not believe that he would

resent it.” Sir Harry frowned, and moved his feet

rapidly on the floor. “In my thorough respect and

regard for you, Sir Harry,” continued Mr. Boltby,

“I have undertaken a work which I would not have

done for above two or three other men in the world

beside yourself. I am bound to tell you the result,

which is this, – that I would sooner give my own

girl to the swe

The lawyer meant well, but he overdid his work.

Sir Harry got up and shook hands with him and

-hanked him, but left the room with some sense of

Offence. He had come to Mr. Boltby for information,

and he had received it. But he was not quite sure

Chat he had intended that Mr. Boltby should advise

enim touching his management of his own daughter.

Mr. Boltby, he thought, had gone a little beyond his

Eether. Sir Harry acknowledged to himself that he

had learned a great deal about his cousin, and it was

for him to judge after that whether he would receive

his cousin at Humblethwaite. Mr. Boltby should not

have spoken about the crossing-sweeper. And then

Sir Harry was not quite sure that he liked that idea of

setting vultures upon a man; and Sir Harry remembered

something of his old lore as a hunting man. It is

astonishing what blood will do in bringing a horse

through mud at the end of a long day. Mr. Boltby

probably did not understand how much, at the very

last, might be expected from breeding. When Sir

Harry leſt Mr. Boltby's chambers he was almost better-

but he felt at once that she was different from what

she used to be,--different, not only as regarded her-

self, but different also in her manner. There came

upon him a sad, ponderous conviction that the sun-

light had gone out from their joint lives, that all

pleasant things were over for both of them, and that,

as for him, it would be well for him that he should

die. He could not be happy if there were discord

between him and his child,--and there must be discord.

The man had been invited with a price to take him-

self off, and had not been sufficiently ignoble to accept

the offer. How could he avoid the discord, and bring

back the warmth of the sun into his house? Then he

semembered those terribly forcible epithets which Mr.

Boltby had spoken. “He is an unprincipled black-

guard; and the worse blackguard because of his birth.”

The words had made Sir Harry angry, but he believed

them to be true. If there were to be any yielding,

he would not yield as yet; but that living in his

house without sunshine was very grievous to him.

She will kill me," he said to himself, “if she goes

on like this.”

And yet it was hard to say of what it was that he

complained. Days went by and his daughter said

nothing and did nothing of which he could complain.

It was simply this,—that the sunshine was no longer

bright within his halls. Days went by, and George
