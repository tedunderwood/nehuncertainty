him; but he was afraid of her. “You didn't mean

that, I know,” she added, smiling.

“Of course I didn't.”

“No; your cruelties don't lie in that line; do they,

George?”

“I'm sure I never mean to be cruel to you, Lucy."

“I don't think you do. I hardly believe that you

ever mean anything, except just to get along and

live.”

“A fellow must live, you know,” said George.

In ordinary society George Hotspur could be bright,

“She is not pretty, then, this rich bride of

“Not particularly; she's well enough, you know.”

“And well enough is good enough for you;--is it?

Do you love her, George?”.

The woman's voice was very low and plaintive as

he asked the question. Though from moment to

SEPTEMBER passed away with Captain Hotspur very

inpleasantly. He had various interviews with Captain

Stubber, with Mr. Hart, and with other creditors, and

Cound very little amusement. Lady Altringham had

vritten to him again, advising him strongly to make

out a complete list of his debts, and to send them

poldly to Sir Harry. He endeavoured to make out

he list, but had hardly the audacity to do it even for

his own information. When the end of September

ad come, and he was preparing himself to join the

party of distinguished pheasant-shooters in Norfolk, he

iad as yet sent no list to Sir Harry, nor had he heard

Į word from Humblethwaite. Certain indications had

eached him,—continued to reach him from day to

lay--that Mr. Boltby was at work, but no communica-

ion had been made actually to himself even by Mr.

Zoltby. When and how and in what form he was

expected to send the schedule of his debts to Sir Harry

je did not know; and thus it came to pass that when

he time came for his departure from town, he had

ient no such schedule at all. His sojourn, however,

there was another great vexation. He was now run-

he feared was a most useless outlay in satisfying

Stubber's immediate greed for money, and the effect

was, that at the beginning of the last week in Sep-

tember he found himself with hardly more than fifty

sovereigns in his possession, which would be consider-

worse off before,—very much worse; but it was especially

incumbent on him now to keep up that look of high

feather which cannot be maintained in its proper bright-

ness without ready cash. He must take a man-servant

with him among the distinguished guests; he must fee

game-keepers, pay railway fares, and have loose cash

about him for a hundred purposes. He wished it to

be known that he was going to marry his cousin. He ·

might find some friend with softer heart than Altring-

ham, who would lend him a few hundreds on being

made to believe in this brilliant destiny; but a roll of

bank-notes in his pocket would greatly aid him in

making the destiny credible. Fifty pounds, as he well

knew, would melt away from him like snow. The last

fifty pounds of a thousand always goes quicker than

any of the nineteen other fifties.

Circumstances had made it impossible for him to

attend the Leger this year, but he had put a little

money on it. The result had done nothing for or

against him,-except this, that whereas he received

between one and two hundred pounds, he conceived

the idea of paying only a portion of what he had lost.

With reference to the remainder, he wrote to ask his

friend if it would be quite the same if the money were

paid at Christmas. If not, of course it should be sent

at once. The friend was one of the Altringham set,

who had been at Castle Corry, and who had heard of

George's hopes in reference to his cousin. George

a year! But the man did refuse. The man wrote bac

to say that he did not understand this kind of thin

Hotspur sent the man his money, not without man

curses on the illiberality of such a curmudgeon. Wa

it not cruel that a fellow would not give him so trifling

an assistance when he wanted it so badly? All thi

world seemed to conspire to hurt him just at this mos

critical moment of his life! In many of his hardes

emergencies for ready money he had gone to Mrs

Morton. But even he felt that just at present he could

not ask her for more.

Nevertheless, a certain amount of cash was made

to be forthcoming before he took his departure foi

Norfolk. In the course of the preceding spring he

had met a young gentleman in Mr. Hart's small front

parlour, who was there upon ordinary business. He

was a young gentleman with good prospects, and with

of October, the day before he left London to join his

listinguished friends in Norfolk, George Hotspur

changed a cheque for nearly three hundred pounds at

Chink sovereigns about at his ease. And this point of

greatness must be conceded to him,--that, however

black might loom the clouds of the coming sky, he

could enjoy the sunshine of the hour.

In the meantime Mr. Boltby was at work, and be-

fore Cousin George had shot his last pheasant in such

very good company, Sir Harry was up in town assisting

Mr. Boltby. How things had gone at Humblethwaite

between Sir Harry and his daughter must not be told

elf nearly certain of the very nature of the transaction.

Early on the morning after George's return he was

in to ground by Mr. Boltby's confidential clerk, at

ne hotel behind the club. It was so early, to George

t least, that he was still in bed. But the clerk, who

is pheasant-shooting pleasure was past, and that im-

nediate trouble was in store for him, had consoled

eltzer and brandy, and had taken these comforting

otations after a bottle of champagne. He was, con-

equently, rather out of sorts when he was run to ground

2 his very bedroom by. Boltby's clerk. He was can-

Then Mr. Stackpoole had written to Cousin George,

nd Cousin George had thought it wise to make no

onvinced himself of the truth, and had told his

laughter that there was evidence enough to prove the

act in any court of law. Emily when so informed

nad simply held her tongue, and had resolved to hate

Irse Stackpoole worse than ever.

She had been told from the first that her engage-

nent with her cousin would not receive her father's

anction; and for some days after that there had been

ilence on the subject at Humblethwaite, while the

correspondence with Mr. Boltby was being continued.

Then there came the moment in which Sir Harry felt

hat he must call upon his daughter to promise obedience,

ind the conversation which has been described between

nim and Lady Elizabeth was preparatory to his doing so.

“My dear," he said to his daughter, “sit down; I

coming in and out on all manner of small occasions

suggesting that he should ride with her, asking for the

loan of a gardener for a week for some project of her

own, telling him of a big gooseberry, interrupting him

ruthlessly on any trifle in the world. But on such

occasions she would stand close to him, leaning on

him. And he would scold her,-playfully, or kiss her,

or bid her begone from the room,but would always

grant what she asked of him. To him, though he

hardly knew that it was so, such visits from his darling

had been the bright moments of his life. But up to

this morning he had never bade her be seated in that

room.

"Emily,” he said, “I hope you understand that all

this about your cousin George must be given up.”

She made no reply, though he waited perhaps for a

minute. “It is altogether out of the question. I am

very, very sorry that you have been subjected to such

a sorrow. I will own that I have been to blame for

letting him come to my house.”

“No, Papa, no.”

“Yes, my dear, I have been to blame, and I feel

it keenly. I did not then know as much of him as I

do now, but I had heard that which should have made

no reply to him. He looked into her face, and saw

there that mark about her eyes which he knew he so

often showed himself; which he so well remembered

with his father. “I suppose you do believe me, Emily,

when I tell you that he is worthless."

“He need not be worthless always.":

“His conduct has been such that he is unfit to be

trusted with anything."

“He must be the head of our family some day,

Papa.”

“That is our misfortune, my dear. No one can

feel it as I do. But I need not add to it the much

greater misfortune of sacrificing to him my only child.”

“If he was so bad, why did he come here?”

. “That is true. I did not expect to be rebuked by

you, Emily, but I am open to that rebuke.”

“Dear, dear Papa, indeed I did not mean to

rebuke you. But I cannot give him up.”

"You must give him up.”

: “No, Papa. If I did, I should be false. I will

not be false. You say that he is false. I do not know

that, but I will not be false. Let me speak to you for

“If you find him to be utterly worthless, you cannot

it is so. I know him too well to think that he can be
