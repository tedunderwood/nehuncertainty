 And as it had been under
 discussion between ourself and the count of La Marche that we should
 give our daughter Joan in marriage to his son, we did so grant it to
 him, although the king of France asked for her for his own son; but
 that demand was a trick; for we remembered how our niece was given to
 the French king’s son Louis, and what was the consequence of that; but
 may God grant us more profit from this marriage than we have had from
 that one! And now,” ends the king with a burst of eager anticipation,
 “by God’s grace there is given us an opportunity to carry our attack
 upon our chief enemy, the king of France, beyond the limits of
 Poitou.”[882]
 
 He made good use of his opportunity. Louis had apparently retired from
 Montcontour at his approach, for we hear nothing of any encounter
 between them, and within twenty-four hours of his departure from
 Parthenay John was at Cissé, only a few miles from Poitiers. On
 Poitiers he made no attempt, but passed on into Berry, into which he
 penetrated as far north as Chezelles (June 7). Four days later he was
 at Ancenis, on the border of Anjou and Britanny. The next week was
 spent in feeling his way towards Angers. From Ancenis, on June 12, he
 moved up the Loire to St. Florent and Rochefort,[883] thus securing the
 approach to the city from the west and south. Then, by a master stroke
 of audacity, he seems to have suddenly made a rapid march westward
 again, to draw up his forces on June 13[884] within sight of Nantes.
 The citizens and the French garrison came forth to meet him at the
 bridge outside the city; in the fight which ensued John’s troops were
 completely victorious, and twenty French knights were taken prisoners,
 among them a cousin of the French king, the eldest son of Count Robert
 of Dreux whose second son, Peter, was now recognized by the French as
 “count of Britanny” in right of his wife Alice, the half-sister of
 Arthur and Eleanor.[885] Whether this victory struck terror into the
 men of Angers, and whether they opened their gates to the victor in
 consequence, we cannot tell; we only know that on June 17 and 18 John
 was once more in the original capital of his forefathers.[886] But
 once more he was compelled by the untrustworthiness of his followers to
 turn his back upon it, and this time for ever.
 
 The castles in the immediate neighbourhood of Angers were mostly in
 the hands of John or his friends; there was, however, one important
 exception--La Roche-au-Moine,[887] where William des Roches, now
 seneschal of Anjou for Philip Augustus, had lately built a fortress
 to protect the road between Angers and Nantes against the garrison
 of Rochefort, whose commandant was a partisan of John.[888] To La
 Roche-au-Moine John laid siege with all his forces on June 19. The
 siege had lasted a fortnight[889] when Louis advanced from Chinon to
 relieve the place, then on the verge of surrender. At the tidings of
 his approach John sent out scouts to ascertain the strength of the
 enemy; they returned with the assurance that the English king had an
 overwhelming advantage in numbers, and was certain to be victorious
 if he engaged the French in a pitched battle. John was eager for the
 fight;[890] so, according to the French historiographer-royal, was
 Louis, who sent to his rival a public challenge, which John as publicly
 accepted.[891] But the “wonted treachery”--as an exasperated English
 writer calls it--of the Poitevins overthrew his hopes. According to
 one account, “the barons of Poitou, disdaining to follow the king,
 said that they were not ready for a fight in the open field.”[892]
 According to the French version of the story, the immediate author of
 John’s discomfiture was the veteran turncoat Almeric of Thouars, who,
 it seems, addressed John in a most insulting manner, mocking at his
 eagerness for battle, insinuating that it was mere boastfulness which
 the king would never carry out in act, and then made it impossible
 for him to do so, by withdrawing himself and all his followers from
 the host.[893] Whichever version be the correct one, the consequences
 were inevitable; John could not risk an encounter with Louis after
 such a revelation of treason in his own ranks. In rage and grief he
 broke up the siege {July 2}, and hurried away to the south side of the
 Loire.[894]
 
 His retreat, however, implied no abandonment of the design which had
 brought him across the sea. His expedition was only a part of the great
 combination whereby he hoped to bring Philip Augustus to ruin. Through
 long years of diplomacy he had knit together a league which included
 all the powers on the northern and eastern borders of France, and,
 now that it was at last ready for united action, threatened the very
 existence of the French monarchy. While John was scouring the country
 between the Loire and the Dordogne, a formidable host was gathering in
 Flanders. Earl William of Salisbury was there with a picked band of
 Englishmen; the Flemish troops under Hugh de Boves who had been serving
 John as mercenaries in England had been recalled to swell the muster
 in their native land; Count Reginald of Boulogne and Count William of
 Holland had joined their forces to those of Ferrand; all alike were
 soldiers of the king of England, receiving his pay through William of
 Salisbury, who as John’s representative was Marshal of the whole host.
 While that host ravaged Ponthieu, the dukes of Brabant and Louvain
 “with all their might” attacked the north-eastern extremity of the
 French border, in concert with a certain German count “whom the French
 called _Pelu_.” The Emperor Otto was in full sympathy with the allies,
 helping them indirectly by his “counsel and favour”; at last, when the
 eastern and western divisions of the composite host had effected a
 junction, he himself came with a small body of knights to join their
 ranks.[895]
 
 So skilfully and secretly had the combination been planned that
 Philip was quite unprepared to meet it. He had sent the greater part
 of his available forces southward under Louis to check the progress
 of John. For the moment this had been achieved, not so much by Louis
 as by the Poitevin traitors. But the check was only momentary; Louis
 made no attempt to follow John across the Loire; and John was already
 taking steps to fill the places of the Poitevin deserters with more
 trustworthy troops. On July 9 he wrote from La Rochelle to “all his
 faithful men” in England, telling them that he was safe and prosperous,
 thanking them for the support which they had given him hitherto, and
 desiring that all those who had not accompanied him over sea would come
 to his aid now, unless their presence at home was specially required
 by his representatives in the government. “And if,” he added, “any one
 of you should think that we have been displeased with him, his surest
 way to set that matter right is by coming at our call.”[896] France
 was caught between two fires. The most imminent danger was from the
 allies who were ready to pour into the realm from the north and east;
 but Philip, though conscious that the troops which he had at hand were
 insufficient to cope with this danger, dared not recall Louis while
 John was still threatening attack from the south. Gathering courage
 from the extremity of the peril, the French king hastily collected
 what forces he could--counts, barons, knights, men-at-arms, horse and
 foot, with the communes of the towns and villages--bade the bishops
 and clergy, monks and nuns, offer up masses, prayers and alms for the
 safety of the realm, and marched boldly against the invaders. He met
 them at the bridge of Bouvines on Sunday, July 27, and routed them
 completely. Hugh de Boves fled; Otto fled likewise, or was driven
 from the field; the earl of Salisbury, the counts of Flanders and
 Boulogne and the German count were made prisoners, together with Otto’s
 seneschal and a crowd of other knights. The great coalition which had
 cost John so many years of diplomacy and such vast sums of money to
 build up was shivered into fragments at a single blow.[897]
 
 Philip re-entered Paris in triumph with his captives,[898] and
 then marched southward to unite his victorious army with that of
 his son.[899] Against the whole military forces of France, thus
 concentrated and in their present mood of exalted patriotism and
 enthusiastic loyalty, John was still eager to continue the war; in the
 middle of August Peter des Roches was trying to secure the fulfilment
 of an order from the king for three hundred Welshmen to join him
 over sea before the end of the month.[900] But another power stepped
 in to check the hostilities between the kings. Innocent III. was
 planning a new crusade, and the first necessity for his purpose was
 the restoration of peace in Europe. As early as April 22 he had urged
 both the kings, on pain of ecclesiastical censures, to cease from the
 strife which was hindering the work to be done in the Holy Land and
 imperilling the safety of Christendom, and to make at least a truce
 till after the meeting of a general council,[901] the date of which
 he had already fixed for All Saints’ Day 1215.[902] The English-born
 cardinal who was now legate in France, Robert Curson, seems to have
 urged the barons who were with John to persuade him to agree to a truce
 for nine days, with a view to arranging a personal interview between
 John and Philip.[903] The French king had advanced as far as Loudun,
 where he received the submission of Almeric of Thouars and several
 other Poitevin barons. John was some seventeen miles off, at Parthenay,
 “having,” says Philip’s biographer, “no place to flee unto, and not
 daring either to stay where he was, or to offer battle.”[904] To offer
 battle at that moment, with the legate and the barons all urgent for
 peace, would indeed have been madness; so on August 30 John signified
 his assent to a cessation of hostilities for a fortnight from the next
 day, if the legate would ensure its observance on the French side.[905]
 On September 3 John withdrew to Saint-Maixent; thence he went on the
 9th to Niort; on the 12th he returned to Parthenay,[906] and there, on
 the 13th, he, by letters patent, pledged himself to ratify whatever
 terms nine envoys, whom he named, should agree upon with Philip.[907]
 
 These envoys were supported by the legate in person; “and,” says
 William the Breton, “although the high-souled King Philip, having
 in his army two thousand knights and more, besides a multitude of
 other troops, could easily have seized the whole land and the person
 of the king of England, yet with his wonted benignity he granted a
 truce.”[908] In England Philip was reported to have yielded either
 to the authority of the Pope, or to the attraction of sixty thousand
 marks offered to him by John.[909] We may doubt whether either of these
 motives, or all of them united, would have proved effectual, if the
 complete overthrow and capture of his rival had really been as easy as
 the Breton court-historian imagined. The truce was dated from September
 18, and was to last for five years from the next Easter, 1215. The
 conditions were that each party should retain its prisoners; that the
 oath sworn to Philip by the towns of Flanders and Hainaut should be
 recognized as valid; that Philip, his men, and his adherents should
 hold throughout the time of the truce whatever they held on the day of
 its commencement; and that any disputes which might arise should be
 settled at certain appointed places by the sworn arbitrators of the
 truce, who were eight in number, each of the kings being represented by
 two laymen, an abbot and a secular priest. The _maltôte_ or tax levied
 by each king on the adherents of his rival was to be given up if John,
 its originator, consented to renounce it; if not, Philip claimed the
 right to continue it likewise. Frederic of Sicily was to be included in
 the truce as an ally of Philip, and Otto as a friend of John, if they
 chose to be so included; if otherwise, then Philip was to be at liberty
 to assist Frederic and John to assist Otto, within the boundaries of
 the empire, without violating the peace between themselves.
 
 [Sidenote: 1214]
 
 Philip’s proclamation of the truce was issued on September 18 from
 Chinon.[910] John seems to have been then still at Parthenay. The
 terms secured to him the very utmost that he could possibly hope to
 attain, now that he was deprived of the co-operation of his allies in
 the north. He had in fact, as an English writer says, “completed what
 he had to do over sea,”[911] as well as his share of the work could
 be completed when that work as a whole was ruined by the disaster
 of Bouvines. On September 21 he was again at Niort, on the 30th at
 Saintes, and at some date between October 2 and 13 he sailed from La
 Rochelle to England.[912]
 
 To all outward seeming England was at peace. The Pope’s letter
 containing his decision as to the conditions on which the interdict was
 to be withdrawn had reached John on March 4, at the siege of Milécu,
 and he had at once sent it on to Peter des Roches for delivery to the
 legate Nicolas,[913] whom he had, before leaving England, empowered to
 settle the matter in conjunction with William the Marshal. A council
 was summoned at S. Paul’s; the Pope’s decision was communicated to the
 assembled prelates and barons, and the legate asked for an account of
 the sums already paid by the Crown in connexion with the interdict,
 that he might know how much was still wanting to complete the forty
 thousand marks which the Pope had fixed as the total of the indemnity.
 When this was ascertained, it was agreed that the remainder--thirteen
 thousand marks--should stand over on the security of the bishops of
 Winchester and Norwich and of the king himself.[914] This last John
 gave by letters patent issued from Angers on June 17[915]; and as
 soon as these letters reached England, Nicolas solemnly withdrew the
 interdict {June–July}.[916]
 
 Serious grievances connected with it, however, still remained. A
 special tax seems to have been levied throughout the realm, under the
 title of “aid for the relaxation of the interdict”[917]--either to
 pay the remainder of the indemnity to the bishops or to furnish the
 tribute due to Rome. No indemnification was provided for the losses of
 any one except the bishops; the multitude of lower clergy, the monks,
 nuns and lay people of both sexes whose property had been seized or
 damaged “on occasion of the interdict” were ignored in the settlement.
 When they applied to the legate for redress, he told them that he had
 no instructions to deal with their case, but that they might appeal to
 the Pope.[918] For the great majority of individual victims, ruined
 as they were, such an appeal was impracticable. The greater religious
 houses might have been able to attempt it; but regulars and seculars
 alike were apparently in too much dread of the king to attempt anything
 at all. Within two months after his return to England John put forth a
 demand to the clergy of at least one diocese, and to several religious
 houses, in the shape of a courteous request that they would waive all
 claim to the return of “those things which you gave to us in the time
 of the interdict, and which are now described as having been taken
 from you.” A form of renunciation or quit-claim was issued, evidently
 intended for distribution throughout the country, to be signed by the
 parties concerned.[919] John in fact seems to have again asked all the
 English clergy, as he had asked them two years before, for a quit-claim
 on the plea that their contributions had been voluntary; and though we
 have no statement of the result, there seems no reason to doubt that in
 1214, as in 1212, the audacious demand was complied with.
 
 The weakness of the clergy was partly owing to the fact that they
 were disappointed in their hopes of finding a champion in the legate.
 At his coming he had been hailed as a reformer both in Church and
 State[920]; but the year 1214 had scarcely begun when Archbishop
 Stephen, after consultation with his suffragans,[921] addressed to him
 a solemn protest, threatening to appeal against him to the Pope unless
 he desisted from instituting prelates to vacant churches, contrary to
 the rights of the metropolitan. Nicolas disregarded the protest, and
 commissioned Pandulf--who had just gone back to Rome--to defend him
 against the appeal.[922] For nine months Nicolas continued to exercise
 his influence as he chose, without remonstrance from the Pope. He was
 an instrument which could not be dispensed with until its special
 work--the removal of the interdict--was done; moreover, the king was
 on the Continent, and in the doubtful state of political affairs it
 would scarcely have been prudent, during his absence, for Innocent
 to withdraw his own representative from England. No sooner, however,
 had John returned than Nicolas was summoned back to Rome.[923] It
 is clear that Stephen’s protest and appeal had been really directed
 not merely against legatine intrusion into his own metropolitical
 rights, but also, and chiefly, against the legate’s interpretation of
 the papal letter concerning elections to churches, and his action in
 making himself the medium of royal interference in this matter.[924]
 Stephen indeed seems to have looked upon Nicolas as the chief obstacle
 to a settlement, between himself and the king, of this question of
 elections; and a formal settlement, wholly in the Church’s favour,
 was in fact made as soon as king and archbishop were once more face
 to face. On November 21 John published a grant of free and canonical
 election to all the churches in his realm.[925] This grant, like
 every other acknowledgement made by the Crown, before or since, of
 the Church’s right on this point, was of course destined never to be
 anything but a dead letter. But it served John’s purpose. It saved him
 from a fresh quarrel with the Church at a moment when the struggle with
 the barons in which he had been engaged almost ever since his accession
 to the Crown had entered upon a new phase and assumed a new character
 which made it, alike for them and for him, a matter of life and death.

 [736] Cf. R. Howden, vol. iv. pp. 83 and 116. The account of
 Richard’s testamentary dispositions in the former place is open to
 two interpretations. Richard, says Roger, “divisit Johanni fratri suo
 regnum Angliae ... et praecepit ut traderentur ei castella sua, et
 tres partes” [in p. 116 Otto claims only “duas partes”] “thesauri sui,
 et omnia baubella sua divisit Othoni nepoti suo regi Alamannorum; et
 quartam partem thesauri sui praecepit servientibus suis et pauperibus
 distribui.” Grammatically, there is nothing to show whether “tres
 partes thesauri sui” is meant to be connected with “praecepit ut
 traderentur ei [Johanni]” or with “divisit Othoni,” but common
 sense strongly supports the former interpretation; however anxious
 Richard may have been to help his nephew, he could not possibly mean
 deliberately to leave his own chosen successor literally without a
 penny. The actual wording of Richard’s will may, indeed, have been as
 ambiguous as Roger’s summary of it, and Otto may have tried to take
 advantage of its ambiguity. His claim to the earldoms seems somewhat
 unreasonable; he had never really held the earldom of York, and it was
 for that very reason that Richard had granted him Poitou; but it was
 clearly preposterous to expect John to renew this latter grant after
 Otto had accepted the German Crown.

 [777] From the tenour of these letters it is clear that neither of
 the persons addressed had been in England recently. We must therefore
 suppose that an order countermanding the muster at Chester had reached
 the barons in Ireland before they set out to obey the royal summons,
 and that for the muster at Nottingham their presence had not been
 required.

 (evidently meant for 1213). John was at Canterbury May 4–6, 1213;
 _Itin._ a. 14.
 
 [793] John, who in his prosperous days made almost a parade of
 disbelief in William’s loyalty, and delighted in straining it to the
 uttermost by saying and doing everything he could think of to insult
 and provoke William, nevertheless knew well that in moments of peril
 William was the one counsellor to whose disinterestedness he could
 safely trust, the one follower on whom he could count unreservedly, the
 one friend whom he could not do without. So at the close of 1212 or
 early in 1213 he had recalled the Marshal to his side, and proved his
 confidence in him by giving him back his two sons who were in England
 as hostages (_Hist. de G. le Mar._ vv. 14492–598). The bishop of
 Norwich had also come over from Ireland with five hundred knights and
 other horsemen to join the muster (R. Wendover, vol. iii. p. 245). It
 tells something of the success of John’s measures for the settlement of
 the Irish March that the simultaneous absence of the justiciar and the
 Marshal, at such a crisis in the king’s fortunes, appears to have been
 followed by no disturbance in the country which they thus left without
 a ruler.

 [806] If we may believe Matthew Paris, the Pope was not the only
 potentate to whom John about this time offered homage and tribute.
 In Matthew’s _Gesta Abbatum S. Albani_, vol. i. pp. 236–40, and in
 his _Chronica Majora_, vol. ii. pp. 559–62, is a long account of an
 embassy which John is said to have sent to the emir of Morocco, Al
 Moumenim (Mohammed al Nassir), “significans eidem quod se et regnum
 suum libenter redderet eidem et dederet, et deditum teneret ab ipso,
 si placeret ei, sub tributum. Necnon et legem Christianam, quam vanam
 censuit, relinquens, legi Machomet fideliter adhaereret.” Matthew
 proceeds to give a lively account of the ambassadors’ adventures,
 and of the rebuke which the emir administered, through them, to the
 sovereign who had sent them on so shameful an errand; all of which
 Matthew professes to have heard from one of the envoys themselves.
 Unluckily for him, he has given two contradictory dates for the
 embassy. In the _Gesta Abbatum_ he represents it as taking place during
 the Interdict; and Dr. Lingard has shown, by evidence drawn from
 Matthew himself, that if it was sent at all, it must have been sent in
 1212 (Lingard, _Hist. England_, vol. ii. p. 325; cf. M. Paris, _Chron.
 Maj._ vol. ii. p. 566). But in _Chron. Maj._ Matthew puts it after the
 reconciliation with Rome, representing it as despatched by John in his
 disappointment at finding that transaction profit him less than he had
 expected. The story of the interview between the envoys and the emir,
 as Matthew tells it, has therefore a very strong appearance of having
 been invented by that writer, as a kind of satire on John’s submission
 to the Pope; though the mere fact of some overture on John’s part for
 an alliance with the emir is neither impossible nor unlikely.
 
 [807] In March 1215 William Mauclerc, John’s agent at Rome, writes
 to John that there have come thither some envoys sent by the barons
 to complain to the Pope, “cum ipse sit Dominus Angliae,” that John
 refuses them their rights, etc., and he continues: “Supplicant autem
 Domino Papae quod super his eis provideret, cum satis constet ei
 quod ipsi audacter pro libertate Ecclesiae ad mandatum suum se vobis
 opponerent, et quod vos annuum redditum Domino Papae et Ecclesiae
 Romanae concessistis, et alios honores quos ei et Romanae Ecclesiae
 exhibuistis, non sponte nec ex devotione, imo ex timore _et per eos
 coactus_ fecistis.” _Foedera_, vol. i. pt. i. p. 120. See Lingard,
