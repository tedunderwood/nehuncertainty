 He gave them
 a joyous welcome, and hearing that a sudden rising had taken place in
 Devon, despatched them under the command of the earl of Salisbury to
 deal with it. The insurgents were reported to be besieging Exeter,
 whence the earl was bidden to dislodge them; but they had, in fact,
 already taken it; and when Earl William reached Sherborne, he was told
 that they were lying hidden in a wood through which his road lay,
 in such numbers that he and his followers had no chance of escape
 if they fell into the ambush; whereupon he went back to the king at
 Winchester.[1015] “You are not good at taking fortresses!” said John
 scornfully when he heard the tale. A few days later he again bade the
 same party go and drive the “Northerners” out of Exeter. Again they
 were met at Sherborne by alarming accounts of the increased numbers
 of the enemy; but this time the Flemings, stung by the king’s taunt,
 insisted upon going forward to “conquer or die”; and the “Northerners,”
 though they are said by the contemporary Flemish chronicler to have
 been ten to one, evacuated Exeter at the mere tidings of their
 approach.[1016]
 
 This second expedition to Exeter probably started from Winchester on
 the same day (May 24) on which John issued a notice that any persons
 who came to his service from over sea were to place themselves under
 the orders of his chamberlain, Hubert de Burgh.[1017] He had summoned
 a part of his forces to muster on May 26 at Marlborough; but on the
 25th they were bidden to proceed to “the parts of Odiham and Farnham,”
 there to receive his commands; while others, who were to have come to
 Reading, were to await his orders sent through Jordan de Sackville. On
 the same day John wrote to the archbishop of Canterbury, urgently, but
 very courteously, entreating that he would temporarily waive his right
 to the custody of Rochester castle and allow the king to garrison it
 with men of his own.[1018] To this request Langton acceded.[1019] By
 this time he had negotiated another truce, and two days later {May 27}
 John gave him a safe-conduct for himself and for whatever persons he
 might bring with him to Staines “to treat of peace between ourself and
 our barons.”[1020]
 
 The object of all these changes of front on the king’s part was to gain
 time for assembling new forces and devising a new policy. On the same
 day on which he gave the safe-conduct to the archbishop, he despatched
 an urgent appeal to all “his knights, men-at-arms, and friends who were
 coming to join him” from over sea, entreating them to come as speedily
 as possible, and promising that they should be well rewarded for so
 doing.[1021] On May 29 he again wrote to the Pope, complaining of the
 rebellious attitude of the barons, which made it impossible for him to
 fulfil his vow of crusade.[1022] On Whitsun Eve, June 6, he bade his
 favourite captain of mercenaries, Falkes de Bréauté, send four hundred
 Welshmen to Salisbury to meet its earl by the following Tuesday,[1023]
 seemingly to be ready for action on the Thursday, when the truce would
 expire.
 
 John knew, however, that the game was lost. Four bodies of insurgents
 were now in the field, and none of them seem to have paid any regard
 to the truce. The townsfolk of Northampton had risen against the royal
 garrison of the castle and slain several of them. The force which
 occupied London was besieging the Tower; and now, in this Whitsun week,
 another body seized Lincoln.[1024] The king was almost deserted; at one
 moment he is said to have had only seven knights left in his suite; the
 sessions of the Exchequer and of the sheriffs’ courts throughout the
 country had ceased, because no one would pay him anything or obey him
 in any matter.[1025] He had come up on May 31 from Odiham to Windsor,
 doubtless to meet the archbishop at Staines; on June 4 he went back
 into Hampshire.[1026] On Whit-Monday, June 8, he issued from Merton a
 safe-conduct for envoys from the barons to proceed to and from Staines
 from Tuesday the 9th till Thursday the 11th. On Wednesday the 10th
 he returned to Windsor, and the truce was prolonged from Thursday to
 the following Monday, the 15th.[1027] Finally, he despatched William
 the Marshal and some other trusty envoys to tell the barons in London
 “that for the sake of peace and for the welfare and honour of his
 realm, he would freely concede to them the laws and liberties which
 they asked; and that they might appoint a place and day for him and
 them to meet, for the settlement of all these things.” The messengers
 “guilelessly performed the errand which had been guilefully imposed on
 them”; and the barons, “buoyed up with immense joy,” fixed the meeting
 to take place on June 15 in a meadow between Staines and Windsor,[1028]
 called Runnimead.[1029]
 
 [Sidenote: June 15]
 
 There, on the appointed morning, the two parties pitched their tents at
 a little distance from each other on the long reach of level grass-land
 which stretched along the river-bank. The barons came “with a multitude
 of most illustrious knights, all thoroughly well armed.”[1030] “It
 is useless,” says another chronicler, “to enumerate those who were
 present on the side of the barons, for they comprised well-nigh all
 the nobility of England.” With the king were the archbishops of
 Canterbury and Dublin, seven bishops, Pandulf--who had been sent back
 to England as the Pope’s representative instead of Nicolas--the Master
 of the English Templars, the earls of Pembroke, Salisbury, Warren and
 Arundel, and about a dozen barons of lesser degree, including Hubert
 de Burgh.[1031] It was to these chosen few, and above all to the
 first of them, that John really capitulated. His declaration that he
 granted the Great Charter by their counsel may well have been true of
 them all; his most devoted adherents could, if they had any political
 sagacity, advise him nothing else for his own interest. The terms of
 capitulation, however, imply more than this. Nominally, the treaty--for
 it was nothing less[1032]--was based upon a set of forty-nine articles
 “which the barons demanded and the lord king granted.”[1033] But
 those articles are obviously not the composition of “the barons”
 mustered under Robert Fitz-Walter. Every step of the proceedings of
 these insurgents up to that moment, every step of their proceedings
 afterwards, as well as everything that is known of the character of
 their leaders, goes to show that they were no more capable of rising
 to the lofty conception embodied in the Charter--the conception of
 a contract between king and people which should secure equal rights
 to every class and every individual in the nation--than they were
 capable of formulating it in the minute detail and the carefully chosen
 phraseology of the Charter or even of the Articles. The true history
 of the treaty of Runnimead is told in one brief sentence by Ralph of
 Coggeshall: “By the intervention of the archbishop of Canterbury, with
 several of his fellow-bishops and some barons, a sort of peace was
 made.”[1034] In other words, the terms were drawn up by Stephen Langton
 with the concurrence of the other bishops who were at hand, and of the
 few lay barons, on either side, who were statesmen enough to look at
 the crisis from a higher standpoint than that of personal interest;
 they were adopted--for the moment--by the mass of the insurgents as
 being a weapon, far more effective than any that they could have forged
 for themselves, for bringing the struggle with the king (so at least
 they hoped) to an easy and a speedy end; and they were accepted--also
 for the moment--by John, as his readiest and surest way of escape from
 a position of extreme difficulty and peril. Thus before nightfall the
 Great Charter was sealed; and in return John received anew the homage
 of the barons who had defied him.[1035]
 
 It was, however, one thing to make the treaty, and quite another to
 carry it into effect. The framers of the Articles and of the Charter
 had done what they could towards that end by a carefully planned “form
 of security for the observance of the peace and liberties between the
 king and the kingdom.”[1036] Out of the whole baronage of England the
 barons present at Runnimead were to choose twenty-five, who should
 “observe, keep, and cause to be observed, with all their might,” the
 provisions of the Charter. If the king failed to do his part, these
 twenty-five were to compel him thereto by force if necessary. For this
 purpose they were authorized to claim assistance from “the community
 of the whole country,” and they were therefore to receive an oath of
 obedience from every man in the realm.[1037] King and barons alike
 swore that they would keep all the provisions of the Charter “in good
 faith and without deceit.”[1038] The king was made to promise that
 he would not procure “from any one” anything whereby his concessions
 might be revoked or diminished, and that if such revocation should be
 obtained it should be accounted void and never used.[1039] That John’s
 promises were worthless every one knew; it was not likely that all the
 pressure which could be brought to bear upon him by “five-and-twenty
 over-kings”--as his foreign mercenaries sarcastically called the
 elected barons[1040]--would more than suffice, if even it should
 suffice, to compel him to keep his word. Still the check thus set over
 him was a very strong one. It was in fact the strongest that could be
 devised; and it was made of indisputable authority by its incorporation
 in the Charter.[1041]
 
 On the other hand, the Charter contained no provision for compelling
 the barons in general to fulfil their part of its obligations, either
 towards their sub-tenants[1042] or towards the Crown, except what
 might be implied in the authority given to the twenty-five; while for
 securing the loyalty and good faith of the twenty-five themselves it
 contained no provision at all. If we look at the text of the Charter
 alone, we can but endorse the verdict of its foreign soldier-critics:
 England was exchanging one king for five-and-twenty. This defect in
 the treaty seems to have been noticed as soon as it was passed, and
 a remedy was sought in the appointment of another body of barons,
 thirty-eight in number, chosen from both parties,[1043] and including
 the Earl Marshal and the other chief adherents of the king; these,
 after swearing obedience to the twenty-five, took another oath which
 bound them to compel both the king and the twenty-five to deal
 justly with one another.[1044] This precaution may perhaps have been
 suggested by Langton and the other bishops when a significant incident
 had shown them that the promise of the insurgent barons was worth no
 more than that of the king. This incident rests upon the authority
 of a joint statement purporting to be issued, evidently by way of
 protest and warning and for the clearing of their own consciences, by
 ten eye-witnesses--the archbishops of Canterbury and Dublin, seven
 English bishops, and Pandulf. In a letter-patent addressed to “all
 Christian people,” these ten persons (if the document be genuine)
 recite how in their sight and hearing the barons had made to the
 king--seemingly before the Charter was sealed--a verbal promise that
 they would give him, for their observance of the agreement between him
 and themselves, any security which he might choose, except castles or
 hostages. “Afterwards” John called upon them to fulfil this promise by
 giving him in their turn a charter, whereby they should acknowledge
 themselves bound to him by oath and homage as his liegemen, and for the
 preservation of his rights and those of his heirs and the defence of
 his realm. “But,” say the witnesses, “this they would not do.”[1045]
 Such, it seems, was the earnest of the loyalty to their plighted word
 which England, as well as John, had to expect from the men who posed as
 the champions of justice and right.
 
 For ten days the nominally reconciled enemies sat watching each other,
 the king at Windsor, the barons still encamped in the surrounding
 meadows. In private, John’s feelings broke out in wild paroxysms of
 fury characteristic of his race; he “gnashed his teeth, rolled his
 eyes, caught up sticks and straws and gnawed them like a madman, or
 tore them into shreds with his fingers.”[1046] But to the outside
 world he wore a calm and smiling face, chatting familiarly and gaily
 with every one whom he met, and declaring himself perfectly satisfied
 with the settlement of affairs.[1047] Within the next seven days {June
 19–22} he despatched copies of the Charter to the sheriffs, foresters
 and other royal bailiffs in every shire, with letters patent ordering
 them to make the men under their jurisdiction swear obedience to the
 twenty-five barons in whatever form these latter might prescribe, and
 cause twelve sworn knights to be elected in the next county court
 for the purpose of inquiring into evil customs with a view to their
 extirpation as promised in the Charter.[1048] He also sent to his
 mercenary captains {June 18} orders to desist from hostilities and
 amend any damage which they might have done to the barons since the
 peace was made.[1049] On the following Tuesday, June 23, he ordered
 the foreign soldiers at Dover to be sent home at once.[1050] On the
 25th a number of sheriffs were removed from office and replaced by
 new ones.[1051] Before that date the king had appointed a new chief
 justiciar, Hubert de Burgh,[1052] a faithful adherent of his own, who
 was also an honourable man, respected by all parties, and a member of
 the committee of thirty-eight. On the 27th the sheriffs and the knights
 elected in every shire to inquire into evil customs were ordered to
 punish summarily all persons who refused the oath of obedience to the
 twenty-five.[1053]
 
 The king was then at Winchester; he had left Windsor on the night of
 the 25th.[1054] Illness--seemingly a severe attack of gout--had made
 him unable to move sooner, and the barons had taken advantage of his
 physical helplessness to heap upon him every insult in their power.
 One day the twenty-five required his presence to confirm a judgement
 in the Curia Regis; he was in bed, unable to set a foot to the ground,
 so he sent them word that they must come and deliver the judgement
 in his chamber, as he could not go to them. They “answered that they
 would not go, for it would be against their right; but if he could not
 walk, he must cause himself to be carried.” He did so, and when he was
 brought into their presence “they did not rise to meet him, for it was
 their saying that if they had risen, they should have done contrary to
 their right.”[1055] This scene probably occurred in connexion with one
 of the cases dealt with in the fifty-second article of the Charter,
 the cases of persons who were, or asserted that they were, deprived
 of their lands, castles, privileges or rights by an arbitrary act of
 John or of his predecessors, without judgement of their peers. Some of
 these cases, in which there was no doubt about the circumstances of
 the deprivation, were settled without delay, and immediate restitution
 was made to the claimants by the Crown.[1056] But there were others
 which required investigation. Such was the claim of the earl of Essex
 to the custody of the Tower of London.[1057] The chief justiciar of
 England had been recognized as entitled by virtue of his office to the
 custody of the Tower ever since the accession of Henry II.; but Henry’s
 mother, the Empress Maud, had granted it by charter to Geoffrey de
 Mandeville and his heirs;[1058] and it was now claimed as an hereditary
 right by the earl of Essex, as eldest son of the late justiciar
 Geoffrey Fitz-Peter by his marriage with Beatrice de Say, on whom the
 representation of the Mandeville family had devolved.[1059] This matter
 was too delicate and too important to be decided in haste; pending its
 decision, the Tower was temporarily placed in neutral hands, the hands
 of the archbishop of Canterbury,[1060] to whom Rochester castle was at
 the same time restored.[1061] Finally, John proposed that the other
 questions in dispute between himself and individual barons should all
 be determined at Westminster on July 16. This being agreed, the barons
 withdrew to London[1062] and the king to Winchester, whence at the
 beginning of July he proceeded into Wiltshire.[1063]
 
 King and barons alike knew that the “peace” had been made only to
 be broken. The barons were the first to break it. Some of those
 “Northerners” from beyond the Humber by whom the strife had been
 originally begun had actually left Runnimead in the middle of the
 conference, and were now openly preparing for war, on the pretext that
 they “had not been present” at the settlement.[1064] Their southern
 allies were really doing the same; only they veiled their preparations
 under the guise of a tournament to be held, ostensibly in celebration
 of the peace, at Stamford on July 6. Robert Fitz-Walter and his
 companions, however, quickly discovered that if they wished to keep
 their hold upon London they must not venture far away from the city;
 they therefore postponed the tournament for a week, and transferred it
 from Stamford to Staines. The victor’s prize was to be “a bear, which
 a lady was going to send.”[1065] Meanwhile the new sheriffs--appointed
 since the peace, and specially charged to enforce its provisions--were
 meeting with a very rough reception in every shire where the “Northern”
 influence predominated. All over the country the barons were fortifying
 their castles; some were even building new ones.[1066] A more
 scrupulous king than John might well have deemed himself justified,
 under such circumstances, in doing what John did--following their
 example in preparing to fling the treaty to the winds and renew the war.
 
 The meeting which had been appointed for July 15 was postponed till
 the 16th, and the place for it changed from Westminster to Oxford. On
 the 15th the king came up from Clarendon into Berkshire, and on his
 way from Newbury to Abingdon despatched a letter to the barons stating
 that he “could not” meet them in person at Oxford on the morrow, but
 that the archbishop of Dublin, the bishop of Winchester, Pandulf, the
 earls Marshal, Warren, and Arundel, and the justiciar, would be there
 in his stead, “to do to you what we ought to do to you, and to receive
 from you what you ought to do to us.”[1067] The archbishop of Dublin
 was no longer justiciar in Ireland; Geoffrey Marsh had been, on July 6,
 appointed to succeed him in that office.[1068] On the same day Walter
 de Lacy had been reinstated in all his Irish lands.[1069] Throughout
 the summer of this year John, busy as he was with English affairs,
 had found time to pay even more attention than usual to those of his
 Irish dominion. From May to July the Close and Charter Rolls are full
 of letters and writs relating to the Irish March; charters to towns,
 to religious houses, to individual barons, orders concerning military
 arrangements and other matters of local administration,[1070] all show
 such constant intervention and such personal interest on the king’s
 part as to convey an impression that he was specially endeavouring to
 win for himself the support of the nobles, clergy and people of the
 Irish March as a counterpoise to the hostility and disaffection which
 surrounded him in his English realm. It was, however, to the Continent
 that he mainly looked for aid. “After much reflection,” says Roger of
 Wendover, “he chose, like the Apostle Peter, to seek vengeance upon
 his enemies by means of two swords, that is, by a spiritual sword and
 a material one, so that if he could not triumph by the one, he might
 safely count upon doing so by the other.”[1071]
 
 The spiritual weapon was the first to be actually drawn; but even
 before its first stroke fell, swords of the other kind were making
 ready for the king’s service. Emissaries from him were soon busy
 in “all the neighbouring lands beyond the sea,” gathering troops
 by promises of rich pay and ample endowments in English land, to
 be confirmed by charters if the recipients desired it.[1072] The
 chancellor, Richard Marsh, was thus raising troops in Aquitaine
 {August};[1073] Hugh de Boves was doing the like in Flanders. Those
 whom they enlisted were to be ready to come to the king at Dover by
 Michaelmas Day.[1074] John was also seeking allies in France. On
 August 12 he wrote to Count Peter of Britanny, offering him a grant
 of the honour of Richmond if he would come “with all speed, and
 with all the knights he could bring,” ready for service against the
 insurgents in England.[1075] He is even said to have tried hard, “by
 enormous promises,” to gain help from Philip Augustus; but in this
 quarter “others had been beforehand with him,” says the chronicler
 significantly.[1076] It was not without a cause that the barons at
 Runnimead had refused to write themselves John’s liegemen.
 
 Within the realm, the royal castles were being revictualled and made
 ready to stand a siege at any moment.[1077] As yet no further attempt
 had been made upon any of them; but in the north the barons, or their
 followers and partizans, had begun to lay waste the royal manors and
 overrun the forests, cutting down and selling the timber, and killing
 the deer. Again the archbishop and bishops came forward as peacemakers,
 and it was arranged that the king should meet them on August 16 at
 Oxford, while the barons should assemble at Brackley, there to await
 the result of the churchmen’s mediation. When the day arrived, however,
 the king was still in Wiltshire, and excused his absence on the ground
 that he had been so ill-treated since the conclusion of the peace,
 and moreover at the last conference the barons had come together in
 such menacing array, that he deemed it neither safe nor prudent to
 risk himself in their midst; an excuse which was practically justified
 by the action of the barons themselves, who, instead of waiting at
 Brackley as they had agreed to do, came “with a numerous following” to
 meet the bishops at Oxford.[1078]
 
 The bishops had now received from Rome a communication which made their
 position, or at least that of the Primate, an exceedingly anxious
 and painful one. In consequence, it seems, of John’s letter of May
 29 Innocent had issued a commission to the bishop of Winchester, the
 abbot of Reading and Pandulf, whereby he declared excommunicate all
 “disturbers of the king and kingdom of England, with their accomplices
 and abettors,” laid their lands under interdict, and ordered the
 archbishop and his episcopal brethren, on pain of suspension from
 their office, to cause this excommunication to be published throughout
 the realm every Sunday and holiday till the offenders should have
 made satisfaction to the king and returned to their obedience.[1079]
 Ill-fitted as the barons had proved to be for the great work in which
 Langton had sought to enlist them, the cause of England’s freedom was
 yet too closely bound up with theirs for him to be willing to launch at
 them such a sentence as this, and he had sympathized too keenly with
 his country’s misery under a former interdict not to recoil from the
 prospect of another. The barons, on the other hand, had been heedless
 of interdict and excommunication so long as their material interests
 coincided with those of the king against the Church; but the matter
 would wear a different aspect in their eyes now that the situation
 was reversed and their one hope was in the aid of the Church against
 the king. The Pope’s mandate was shown to them and the bishops in
 conference at Oxford; after three days’ deliberation {Aug. 16–18} the
 bishops agreed to delay the publication of the sentence till they had
 seen the king again and made one more effort to bring him to a colloquy
 in London or at Staines. It was rumoured that he had gone to the coast
 with the intention of quitting England altogether; and the bishops are
 said to have followed him to Portsmouth, and there found that he was
 actually on shipboard. He came ashore again {Aug. 23–24?}, however, to
 speak with them; but he absolutely refused to hold any more personal
 conferences with the barons. The bishops returned to meet the barons
 at Staines on August 26, accompanied by envoys from the king, who were
 charged with a protest, to be delivered in his name in the hearing
 of the whole assembly, that “it was not his fault if the peace was
 not carried out according to the agreement.” After long deliberation
 the papal sentence was proclaimed, but with a tacit understanding
 that it was to be, for the present at least, a dead letter, on the
 ground that as no names were mentioned in it, the phrase “disturbers
 of the king and kingdom” need not be applied to any person or group
 of persons in particular, but might be interpreted by every man as he
 pleased. The more violent partizans immediately applied it to the king
 himself, since in their eyes he was the chief troubler of the land, and
 therefore also his own worst enemy.[1080]
 
 After placing his queen and his eldest son in safety in Corfe
 castle,[1081] John had taken ship, seemingly about August 24, at
 Southampton or Portsmouth, and sailed round the coast to Sandwich,
 where he appears to have landed on the 28th.[1082] The barons in
 London, if we may believe the report of the chroniclers, were foolish
 enough to imagine that he would never land again at all.[1083] They
 were now taking upon themselves, in all those counties where their
 power was strong enough, to supersede both the sheriffs and the
 justices and usurp their functions, parcelling out the country among
 members of their own body, each of whom was to act as the chief
 judicial and administrative authority in the district committed to
 him.[1084] In their premature triumph they were even beginning to
 talk of choosing a new sovereign, and of calling the whole baronage of
 England to a council for that purpose, “since this ought to be done
 by the common consent of the whole realm.”[1085] Early in September,
 however, the revolutionists awoke from their dreams to find that the
 king was safe in Dover castle, surrounded by a little band of foreign
 soldiers who had already joined him there, and awaiting the coming of
 the host which was gathering for him beyond the sea.[1086] The three
 executors of the papal mandate were meanwhile insisting that now, at
 any rate, the barons had unquestionably fallen under its terms, by
 endeavouring to expel the king from his realm; and they excommunicated
 by name several of the revolutionary leaders, together with the
 citizens of London, whom they placed under interdict. These sentences,
 however, were disregarded, on the plea that they were barred by a
 previous appeal to the general council[1087] which was to be held at
 Rome on All Saints’ Day, and which most of the English bishops were
 preparing to attend. Archbishop Stephen was about to set forth, in the
 middle of September, when two of the papal commissioners--Pandulf and
 Bishop Peter of Winchester--went to him in person and insisted that
 he should enforce the publication of the Pope’s sentence throughout
 his own diocese on all the appointed days, and order his suffragans to
 do the same. Stephen answered that he would take no further steps in
 the matter till he had spoken of it with the Pope himself, since he
 believed the sentence to be grounded on a misunderstanding of the facts
 of the case. On this Pandulf and Peter denounced him as disobedient to
 the Pope’s mandate, and, in accordance with its terms, suspended him
 from his office.[1088]
 
 Stephen accepted his suspension without protest. He was indeed so
 grievously disappointed at the turn which affairs in England had
 taken, and so hopeless of doing any further good there, that he had
 almost determined not only to resign his see, but to retire altogether
 from the world and bury himself in a hermitage or a Carthusian
 cell.[1089] Several of the bishops visited the king before they
 went over sea;[1090] we are not told whether Stephen did so; but he
 certainly had the king’s permission for his journey to Rome, for on
 September 10 John by letters patent took under his protection all the
 archbishop’s men, goods, lands and other possessions, and forbade his
 own men to do them any injury.[1091] On the 13th the king wrote again
 to the Pope, asking for his counsel and aid, and complaining that
 “whereas before we subjected our land to you as overlord, our barons
 were obedient to us, now they have risen up violently against us,
 specially on account, as they publicly declare, of that very thing.”
 This letter was carried by the archbishops of Bordeaux and Dublin and
 seven other envoys.[1092] Pandulf--now bishop-elect of Norwich--seems
 to have gone to Rome about the same time, charged with another letter
 to the Pope.[1093] But before any of these travellers had set out on
 their way the Pope had drawn his sword again; and this time the sword
 was a two-handed one. It was the sword of the temporal overlord of
 England, as well as of the spiritual head of Christendom.
 
 The sixty-first article of the Charter enacted, as we have seen, that
 if the king should procure “from any one” a revocation or cassation
 of that document, such revocation should be accounted void. The only
 person, however, from whom such a thing could possibly be sought was of
 course the Pope; and in so far as the Pope was concerned, the clause
 was itself in feudal law null and void from the beginning, owing to
 the action of the barons before the Charter was drawn up or thought
 of. Whatever may have been their real share in the surrender of the
 kingdom to the Pope in May 1213, they had at any rate in February
 1215, if we may believe William Mauclerc (and there is no reason
 for disbelieving him), put on record their full concurrence in that
 transaction after it was accomplished, and even taken voluntarily
 upon themselves the whole responsibility both for its accomplishment
 and for its initiation.[1094] Thereby they had deprived themselves of
 whatever legal pretexts they might otherwise have had for repudiating
 its consequences; and foremost of those consequences was the fact that
 the Pope was now legally the supreme arbiter of political affairs in
 England, by a right which had been given to him by the joint action
 of the king and the barons, and against which no later reservation
 made between those two parties themselves (such as the sixty-first
 article of the Charter) was of any force in feudal law. The framers of
 the Charter seem to have been conscious of this;[1095] John, indeed,
 had pointedly reminded them of it before he consented to the Charter,
 telling the barons, in answer to their demands, that nothing in the
 government and constitution of England ought to be, or lawfully could
 be, altered without the knowledge and sanction of the Pope, now that he
 was overlord of the realm; and he had publicly appealed to the Pope,
 as overlord, against them and all their doings. As soon as the Charter
 was sealed, he had despatched envoys to Rome to prosecute his appeal,
 and to lay before Innocent a statement of his case, together with such
 extracts from the Charter as were most likely to influence the Pope in
 his favour. The result was that on August 24--two days before the papal
 denunciation of the “disturbers of the realm” was published by the
 English bishops at Staines--Innocent as temporal overlord of England
 quashed the Charter, and as Pope forbade its observance by either king
 or people, on pain of excommunication.[1096]

 [936] Of the value to which these profits had risen some idea may be
 gathered from the fact that a _proficuum_ of £336: 18: 8 was accounted
 for as due to the Treasury in 1205 by the sheriff of Staffordshire and
 Shropshire, of which two counties the united ferm was £413: 12: 4,
 _Salt Archaeol. Soc. Publications_, vol. ii. pp. 129, 133. It must,
 however, be added that this _proficuum_ was reduced next year to £266:
 13: 4, and went down further year by year, till in 1212 it was only
 about £155: 11s., _ib._ pp. 136, 138, 142, 145, 147, 151, 159. After
 that year the Pipe Rolls are in confusion till 1218.

 was “whatever is not in the charter is contrary to it”; in other words,
 “omission is prohibition.” The fact that such an argument might be used
 on both sides was of course conveniently ignored.

 [995] Roger of Wendover, Walter of Coventry, and several other
 annalists absurdly say that in Easter week (April 19–26) John was at,
 or near, Oxford, where he was to have met the barons. John had not been
 at Oxford since the Tuesday before Easter, April 13; from the 16th to
 the 23rd he was in London; on the 23rd he went to Kingston, Reading
 and Alton, and thence on the 26th to Clarendon; _Itin._ a. 16. On the
 day he left London he granted a general safe-conduct to all persons
 who should come to him in the suite of or with letters patent from the
 archbishop (_Rot. Pat._ p. 134); none of the barons, however, seem to
 have availed themselves of this offer.

 regem. Et etiam cogere ipsum si mutato animo forte recalcitraret,”
 M. Paris, _Chron. Maj._ vol. ii. pp. 605, 606. Considering the
 whole context, I think there can be little doubt that “rectificare
 regem”--though an odd way of expressing it--really means here “to do
 right to the king.”

 [1082] John’s Itinerary, a. 17, is blank from August 22, when he was

 sea from Southampton to Dover (whither he did proceed on August 31
 or September 1; _Itin._ _l.c._). W. Coventry (vol. ii. p. 224) says
 the bishops who left Oxford on August 19 to seek him found him just
 embarked at Portsmouth, which comes to the same thing.

 Charter, c. 61, “_ab aliquo_” was substituted for “a domino Papa,” and
 the security to be given by letters patent of Pandulf and the bishops
 was made to refer to the keeping of the Charter in general (_ib._ c.
 62), instead of to that one particular point.

  Dicitur ... “Sine Terra,” quia moriturus nil terrae in pace possedit.

 [Sidenote: 1215]
 
 The Pope’s letters evidently did not reach England till after the
 primate and the bishops had set out for Rome, so that there was no one
 left to publish the new sentence; and it seems, in fact, never to have
 been published in England at all. But its existence soon became known
 there; and when once the barons knew of it, they knew, too, that they
 must make their choice between unconditional surrender and war to the
 uttermost with both king and Pope; for there was no one left to act as
 their mediator with either. They chose war; but they were not ready
 for war, and the king was. Poitevins, Gascons, Brabantines, Flemings,
 were flocking to him from over sea.[1097] On October 2 he ordered his
 brother, Earl William of Salisbury, to visit ten royal castles and
 select from their garrisons troops for service in the field. On the 4th
 he committed the superintendence of military affairs in mid-England
 and the west to Falkes de Bréauté, and issued a general safe-conduct
 to “all who may wish to return to our fealty and service” through
 the medium of Falkes or the earl.[1098] He himself had, towards the
 end of September, advanced as far inland as Malling;[1099] but this
 seems to have been merely a sort of reconnoitring expedition; his
 plan evidently was to wait till all his expected reinforcements had
 arrived from over sea, and then march with them upon London, while
 William and Falkes did the same with the troops which they could bring
 up from the west, so as to place the capital between two fires. While
 his forces were concentrating, those of the barons were scattering;
 they had no scheme of united action; one party had renewed the siege
 of Northampton castle, another was engaged in that of Oxford.[1100]
 At last the leaders in London decided that something must be done to
 bar John’s way to the capital; and they advanced into Kent as far as
 Ospring. When they reached it John was at Canterbury; having only a
 small escort he, on hearing of his enemies’ approach, hurriedly fell
 back to Dover; they, however, were so scared by a report that he had
 set out from Canterbury to offer them battle that they beat an equally
 hasty retreat towards Rochester.[1101] Their great fear was lest he
 should gain possession of Rochester castle, which he had vainly tried
 to induce the archbishop to give up to him two months before.[1102] On
 October 11 Reginald of Cornhill, in whose charge Stephen had left it,
 suffered it to be occupied by a band of picked knights under William
 of Aubigny. But the triumph of the intruders was shortlived; two days
 later the king was at the gates of Rochester.[1103]
 
 “Certes, sire,” said one of John’s Flemish allies as the royal host
 set out for Rochester, “you make little account of your enemies if
 you go to fight them with so small a force!” “I know them too well,”
 answered John; “they are to be nothing accounted of or feared. With
 fewer men than we have we might safely fight them. Certes, one thing
 I may tell you truly, I grieve not so much for the evil which the men
 of my land are doing to me, as that their wickedness should be seen by
 strangers.”[1104] The king knew what the stranger did not know, that
 so long as he could keep the Medway between himself and the main body
 of the barons he was safe. He therefore began his operations by an
 attempt to destroy the bridge, and thus to cut off the communications
 between Rochester and London. It seems that he sent a party up the
 river in boats to fire the bridge from beneath, and that they succeeded
 in so doing, but that Robert Fitz-Walter, with a picked body of knights
 and men-at-arms, was guarding the bridge at the time and managed to
 extinguish the flames and drive off the assailants.[1105] Fitz-Walter,
 however, appears to have immediately returned to London;[1106] and in a
 second attack on the bridge John was completely successful; the bridge
 was destroyed, and the king proceeded to invest the castle[1107] and
 assault the town.
 
 On his first approach the citizens had manned their walls and
 “made a great show of defending themselves”; but “when they saw
 he was preparing to assault them they broke into a rout, left the
 battlements, and fled on all sides. Then his men entered through
 the gates, and began to chase them through the town to the bridge
 so vigorously that they drove all the knights by force into the
 castle; of whom”--sarcastically adds the Flemish soldier of fortune
 who tells the tale--“many would gladly have fled to London if they
 could.”[1108] But they could not, the bridge being now gone. The whole
 party thus gathered in the castle numbered about ninety-five knights
 and forty-five men-at-arms.[1109] The castle when given to William of
 Aubigny and his followers was destitute of provisions; they had had no
 time to procure any, save what little they could get in the town;[1110]
 and they saw before them an imminent prospect of starvation. John
 pressed the siege vigorously; on the day after its commencement he
 ordered “all the smiths in Canterbury” to devote their whole time,
 “day and night,” to making pickaxes, which were to be sent to him at
 Rochester as fast as they were made.[1111] His forces increased daily
 till they became “such a multitude that they struck fear and horror
 into all who beheld them.”[1112] They ravaged all over Kent, and
 wrought havoc in Rochester, stabling their horses in the cathedral and
 committing every kind of sacrilege in the holy places.[1113]
 
 At all this the barons in London looked on in helpless consternation.
 They had plighted a solemn oath to William of Aubigny, when he
 undertook the expedition to Rochester, that if the king besieged him
 there they would succour him without fail.[1114] A fortnight passed
 before they made any movement to redeem their promise; then, on
 October 26, some seven hundred knights[1115] set out under the command
 of Robert Fitz-Walter; but they got no farther than Dartford. One
 chronicler says they “retreated before the breath of a very soft south
 wind as if beaten back by swords”;[1116] another, that they turned back
 in dismay on hearing how numerous were the forces of the king;[1117] a
 third, that they were misled on this point by an exaggerated account
 given them by a Templar sent to meet them for that purpose by John
 himself.[1118] In any case, they returned to London, and having taken
 care to provide themselves with ample stores, they sat down to “play at
 the fatal dice and drink the best wine, according to each man’s taste,
 and do it is needless to say what besides,”[1119] till S. Andrew’s Day.
 By that time they expected important reinforcements; and they reckoned
 that the besieged could hold out till then.[1120]
 
 William of Aubigny and his comrades did hold out, but at desperate
 odds. Every possible mode of attack--mining, battery, assault--was
 tried in turn upon the fortress. Five great slinging engines were
 plied incessantly, day and night, against its walls. The garrison,
 already short of food, and expecting no mercy from the king if they
 surrendered, were minded to sell their lives dearly; they fought like
 heroes; “nor,” says the Barnwell annalist, “does living memory recall
 any siege so urgently carried on and so manfully resisted.”[1121] A
 strange contrivance at last shattered the mighty keep. On November 25
 John ordered the justiciar to send him with all possible speed “forty
 bacon-pigs of the fattest, and of those which are least good for
 eating, to be put to set fire to the stuff that we have got together
 under the tower.”[1122] Of the results of the blaze thus kindled a
 token remains to this day, in the round tower which at the south-west
 angle of the keep contrasts so markedly with the square towers at
 the other corners, and which replaces the original square one thus
 destroyed by John.
