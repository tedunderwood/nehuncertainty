 This Hugh declined, but he consented to accompany
 John for a few days on his journey northward. They set out at once
 for Saumur, and stopped at Fontevraud to visit the tombs of Henry and
 Richard. When John knocked at the choir-door for admittance, however,
 he was told that the abbess was away, and no visitor might enter
 without her leave. He then asked Hugh to communicate to the sisters,
 in his name, a promise of benefactions to their house, and a request
 for their prayers. “You know,” said Hugh, “that I detest all falsehood;
 I will utter no promises in your name unless I am assured that they
 will be fulfilled.” John swore that he would more than fulfil them; and
 the bishop did what he had been asked to do. As they left the church,
 John drew forth an amulet which hung round his neck and showed it to
 his companion, saying it had been given to one of his forefathers
 with a promise from Heaven that whosoever of his race had it in his
 possession should never lose the fulness of his ancestral dominion.
 Hugh bade him trust “not in that stone but in the Chief Corner Stone”;
 and turning round as they came out of the porch, over which was
 sculptured a representation of the Last Judgement, he led him towards
 the group on the left of the Judge, and besought him to take heed of
 the perils attending the responsibility of a ruler during his brief
 time upon earth. John dragged his monitor across to the other group,
 saying, “You should rather show me these, whose good example I purpose
 to follow!” During the three days of his journey in Hugh’s company,
 indeed, his affectation of piety and humility was so exaggerated that
 it seems to have rather quickened than allayed Hugh’s distrust of his
 good intentions.[243] On Easter Day the mask was suddenly dropped.
 Bishop and count spent the festival (April 18) at Beaufort,[244]
 probably as the guests of Richard’s widow, Berengaria. John was said to
 have never communicated since he had been of an age to please himself
 in such matters; and now all Hugh’s persuasions failed to bring him to
 the Holy Table. He did, however, attend the high mass on Easter Day,
 and at the offertory came up to Hugh--who was officiating--with some
 money in his hand; but instead of presenting the coins he stood looking
 at them and playing with them till Hugh asked him, “Why do you stand
 staring thus?” “I am staring at these gold pieces, and thinking that
 a few days ago, if I had had them, I should have put them not into
 your hands, but rather into my own purse; however, take them now.” The
 indignant bishop, “blushing vehemently in John’s stead,” drew back and
 bade him “throw into the bason what he held, and begone.” John obeyed.
 Hugh then followed up his rebuke with a sermon on the characters of a
 good and of a bad prince, and the future reward of each. John, liking
 neither the matter of the sermon nor its length, thrice attempted to
 cut it short by a message that he wanted his dinner; Hugh only preached
 the longer and the more pointedly, and took his leave of John on the
 following day.[245]
 
 On that day John discovered that he was in a situation of imminent
 peril. While he had been travelling from the Breton border to Chinon
 and thence back to Beaufort, Philip had mastered the whole county of
 Evreux and overrun Maine as far as Le Mans; and a Breton force, with
 Constance and Arthur at its head, had marched straight upon Angers[246]
 and won it without striking a blow. City and castle were surrendered
 at once by Thomas of Furnes, a nephew of the seneschal Robert of
 Turnham;[247] and on Easter Day a great assembly of barons of Anjou,
 Touraine and Maine, as well as of Britanny, gave in their adhesion
 to Arthur as their liege lord and Richard’s lawful heir.[248] The
 forces thus gathered in the Angevin capital, from which Beaufort was
 only fifteen miles distant, must have been more than sufficient to
 overwhelm John, whose suite was evidently a very small one. His only
 chance was to make for Normandy with all possible speed. Hurrying away
 from Beaufort on Easter Monday, he reached Le Mans the same night; its
 citizens received him coldly, its garrison refused to support him, and
 it was only by slipping away before daybreak on Tuesday that he escaped
 being caught between two fires. On that very morning {April 20} the
 Bretons and their new allies entered Le Mans in triumph,[249] and they
 were soon met there by the French king, to whom Arthur did homage for
 the counties of Anjou, Touraine and Maine.[250]
 
 Meanwhile, however, John had made his way to Rouen, and there he was
 safe. Richard on his death-bed had declared that the people of Rouen
 were the most loyal of all his subjects; they proved their loyalty
 to his memory by rallying round the successor whom he had chosen for
 himself, and all Normandy followed their example. “By the election
 of the nobles and the acclamation of the citizens,”[251] John was
 proclaimed duke of the Normans, and invested with the symbols of his
 dukedom in the metropolitan church on Low Sunday, April 25.[252] The
 ducal crown--a circlet of gold, with gold roses round the top--was
 placed on his head by Archbishop Walter, and the new-made duke swore
 before the clergy and people, on the holy Gospels and the relics of
 saints, that he would maintain inviolate the rights of the Church,
 do justice, establish good laws, and put down evil customs.[253] The
 archbishop then girded him with the sword of justice, and presented
 him with the lance which held among the insignia of a Norman duke the
 place that belongs to the sceptre among those of a king. A group of
 John’s familiar friends stood close behind him, audibly mocking at the
 solemn rites. He chose the moment when the lance was put into his hands
 to turn round and join in their mockery; and, as he turned, the lance
 slipped from his careless grasp and fell to the ground.[254]
 
 In after years it was only natural that this incident should be
 recalled as an omen.[255] The indecent levity which had caused the
 mishap was in itself ominous enough. Still, however, the Marshal and
 the Norman and English primates--for Hubert of Canterbury, too, was at
 Rouen, and fully in accord with the policy of William and Walter--clave
 to their forlorn hope and persevered in their thankless task. In
 obedience to John’s orders, Hubert and William now returned to England
 to assist the justiciar, Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, in securing the realm for
 him.[256] John himself turned southward again to try whether it were
 possible, now that he had the strength of Normandy at his back, to win
 the Angevin lands before he went over sea. No sooner had the French
 and the Bretons withdrawn from Anjou than it was overrun with fire
 and sword by Richard’s mercenaries, acting under the orders of their
 captain Mercadier and of Queen Eleanor, who had enlisted them in John’s
 interests as soon as they had had time to march up from Châlus to the
 Angevin border. John despatched a body of troops to join them, while he
 proceeded in person to Le Mans. There he wreaked his vengeance to the
 full. City and castle fell into his hands; he razed the castle, pulled
 down the city walls, destroyed the houses capable of defence, and flung
 the chief citizens into captivity.[257] But the danger in his rear was
 still too great to allow of his advance farther south. To throw the
 whole forces of Normandy upon the Angevin lands would have been to
 leave Normandy itself open to attack from two sides at once, and expose
 himself to have his own retreat cut off by a new junction between
 Philip and the Bretons. He could only venture to open negotiations
 with the barons of Anjou and of Aquitaine, endeavour to win them over
 by fair words and promises,[258] and then leave his interests in the
 south to the care of his mother. Accompanied only by a few personal
 friends,[259] he went back through Normandy to the sea; on May 25 he
 landed at Shoreham;[260] on the 26th he reached London, and on the
 27th--Ascension Day--he was crowned at Westminster.[261]

 of any of these in the Pipe Rolls of 1188–93, except that the men of
 the soke of Eye pay tallage to the Crown in 1190 (P.R. 2 Ric. I. m. 9

 garrison in Eye castle for a year (_i.e._ Michaelmas 1191 to Michaelmas

 99. According to this writer, Richard had granted to John “villam de
 Notingham cum honore illo ... et Derebisiram” at the same time as
 Gloucester, Lancaster, etc. (_ib._ p. 78). But the sheriffs of all six
 shires account for them to the Crown up to Michaelmas in Pipe Roll 1
 Ric. I.; so they must all have been granted after that date. “Villam
 de Notingham cum honore illo” stands for the town and the shire;
 there was no “honour” of that name. W. Newburgh, though his list of
 John’s counties is very incomplete (l. iv. c. 3), rightly mentions
 “Notingehamesciram” as one of them; it disappears from the Pipe Rolls
 like the other five after Michaelmas 1189. Sherwood Forest disappears
 likewise, being included in the shire. On the other hand, later events
 show that Nottingham _castle_ was retained by the Crown. At this period
 Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, Dorset and Somerset, Cornwall and
 Devonshire, were always administered and accounted for in pairs.

 [146] Wallingford, Eye, Bristol, Exeter, Launceston and “Hereford”; R.

 be a mistake for Oxford; see above, p. 26.
 
 [147] R. Howden, vol. iii. pp. 135–7. One other clause in the agreement
 may be noticed. After the provisions about the castles already
 mentioned, it is added: “Sed et tria castella ad coronam domini regis
 pertinentia, scilicet castellum de Windeshoveres comiti de Arundel;
 castellum de Wintonia Gilleberto de Lasci; castellum de Northampton
 Simoni de Pateshille, tradita sunt custodienda; qui fidelitatem domini
 Regis de ipsis ad opus ipsius fideliter custodiendis juraverunt,” _ib._
 p. 136. The earl of Arundel figures, at the end of the document, as
 one of the chancellor’s sureties, and the Lacys were in close alliance
 with the Longchamps; taken by itself, therefore, this clause would seem
 to indicate a change of custodians made at the chancellor’s desire,
 and dictated by a discovery or suspicion that the actual commandants
 of these three castles were in treasonable alliance with John. But the
 Pipe Rolls show that the appointment of Simon de Pateshill implied
 no change at all, for he had custody of Northampton castle without
 interruption from Michaelmas 1189 to Michaelmas 1191 (P.R. 2 Ric. I.
 m. 4; 3 Ric. I. m. 1); while the other appointments were speedily
 annulled, owing to the breakdown of the whole agreement.

 remain, but made to give hostages for their loyalty; while Gerald says
 the constables were to be appointed by the new ministry. Probably the
 ministry decided to retain or reappoint the actual constables, on the
 condition mentioned by Ralph.

 upon what seems to have been a merely general order, and require a
 special writ for each castle?

 Richard before he left England, or that it was she who had counselled
 John to throw himself on the king’s clemency.
 
 [217] R. Howden, vol. iii. p. 252. Some of John’s English lands had
 been seized before the council of Nottingham; no doubt, by virtue of
 the decree passed at the council in London on February 10. In the Pipe
 Roll of Michaelmas 1194 the king’s officers accounted to the king’s
 treasury for the ferms of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Dorset and
 Somerset, the third penny of Gloucestershire, and the ferm of Eye, for
 half a year (P.R. 6 Ric. I. m. 6, 13, 16, 4 d); but the sheriff of
 Devon and Cornwall rendered his account for three-quarters of a year
 (_ib._ m. 12); while the forfeiture of John’s private estates in Dorset
 and Somerset seems to have been dated from Ash-Wednesday, February
 23 (_ib._ m. 13 d); a part at least of the honour of Gloucester,
 viz. Bristol, had been seized at Mid-Lent, four days after Richard’s
 landing in England, and the whole not later than Easter (_ib._ m. 16
 d); and for the honours of Peverel and Tickhill a whole year’s ferm was
 reckoned as due to the treasury at Michaelmas (_ib._ m. 6). The king’s
 escheators rendered a separate account of a number of escheats in the
 honour of Lancaster and in the counties which John had held (_ib._ m.
 2, 2 d); and the sheriff of Dorset and Somerset gathered in for the
 king a quantity of “arrears of debts which were owed to Count John for
 pleas and amercements of the men and townships” of those two counties
 (_ib._ m. 13). The commission issued to the itinerant justices in the
 same month of September contained an express order that they should
 inquire into and report upon all John’s property, real and personal,
 and all the moneys owed to him, to the intent that the whole might be
 secured for the king, R. Howden, vol. iii. pp. 263, 264.

 Canterbury. Hubert was in Normandy at the time; but the advocacy of
 Arthur’s claims, intelligible enough in the mouth of a Norman prelate,
 is so contrary to the English political traditions of those days that
 I cannot, without further evidence, ascribe it to such a thoroughly
 English statesman as Archbishop Hubert Walter.

 CHAPTER III
 
 JOHN “SOFTSWORD”
 
 1199–1206
 
   Contempserunt etenim in eo malivoli quique juvenilem aetatem et

 [Sidenote: 1199]
 
 In Richard’s island realm there was never a moment’s question as to who
 should succeed him on its throne. In English eyes one successor alone
 was possible, no matter how undesirable he might be. The circumstances
 of the case, however--the unexpectedness of the vacancy, the heir’s
 absence from England, his past relations with the government and
 the people there, and the existence of a rival claimant--presented
 an opportunity for endeavouring to make a bargain with him such as
 it was not often possible to make with a new sovereign. Accordingly
 the English barons as a body, on hearing of Richard’s death, assumed
 an attitude of independence. All of them set to work to fortify and
 revictual their castles; some of them even began to attack and plunder
 their neighbours, as if they deemed that there was to be again “no
 king in the land”; and all the efforts of the justiciar, Geoffrey
 Fitz-Peter, failed to restore order, till he was joined at the end of
 April by Archbishop Hubert and William the Marshal. The archbishop
 excommunicated the evildoers,[262] and he and the Marshal conjointly
 tendered to all the men of the kingdom, “citizens and burghers, earls,
 barons, and free tenants,” an oath of liege homage and fealty to John.
 The lesser freemen apparently took it without hesitation, but many of
 the barons held back. These reluctant ones--chief among whom were the
 earls of Clare, Huntingdon, Chester, Ferrars and Warwick, Roger de Lacy
 and William de Mowbray--were summoned by the primate, the Marshal and
 the justiciar to a meeting at Northampton. There they took the oath,
 but only in return for a promise given by the three ministers that if
 they did so, John “should render to each of them his rights.”[263]
 None of these “rights” are specified; but the expression used by the
 historian who records the claim distinctly implies that it was in each
 case the claim of an individual to some particular thing to which he
 considered himself personally entitled, something, it would seem, which
 he had been unable to obtain from the late king, and which he was
 therefore anxious to secure beforehand from the new one. In several
 cases the grievance seems to have been that of an heir who had not
 yet received investiture of a dignity to which he had become entitled
 by inheritance some time before.[264] With this grievance the Marshal
 and the justiciar could not fail to sympathize; for although they had
 for some years past enjoyed the estates attached to the earldoms of
 Striguil (or Pembroke) and Essex respectively, neither of them had yet
 been invested as earl. Justly, therefore, was the promise which they
 had made in John’s name redeemed first of all to them when he girded
 them with the earl’s sword and belt on his coronation day.[265]
 
 The chroniclers of the time speak of that day’s ceremony in a
 matter-of-course way which implies that there was nothing remarkable
 about it. “John,” says one, “was peaceably received by the great men
 of all England, and was immediately crowned by Archbishop Hubert of
 Canterbury at Westminster on Ascension Day, amid a great array of
 the citizens.”[266] Sixteen prelates besides Hubert, ten earls and
 “many barons” were present.[267] The coronation oath was administered
 to John in almost the same words as it had been to Richard, and
 with the same adjuration not to take it without a full purpose of
 keeping it, to which John made the proper reply.[268] Of the other
 details of the ceremony there is no description; only one incident at
 its outset and one omission at its close are noted by contemporary
 writers.[269] The first was merely a formal protest made by Bishop
 Philip of Durham that the coronation ought not to take place in the
 absence of his metropolitan, the archbishop of York.[270] The second
 was an intentional and significant omission on the part of the newly
 crowned king himself. It was customary for every Christian sovereign,
 after the crown had been placed on his head, to seal the vows which he
 had just made by receiving the Holy Communion. John, however, did not
 communicate.[271]
 
 Next day the new king received in person the homage of the barons.[272]
 On this side of the sea, only Wales and Scotland remained to be
 secured. Of Wales we hear nothing at the moment. Scotland had taken the
 initiative immediately after Richard’s death; King William the Lion had
 at once despatched a message to John, offering him his liege homage
 and fealty, on condition that Northumberland and Cumberland should be
 given back to the Scottish Crown. The English primate, Marshal and
 justiciar, knowing the difficulties with which John was beset on the
 other side of the Channel, probably feared that he might be tempted to
 purchase William’s support at William’s own price; they intercepted the
 messenger, and sent word to the Scot king, by his brother Earl David
 of Huntingdon, that he must “wait patiently” till John should reach
 England. John himself--to whom they apparently reported what they had
 done--sent word to William that he would “satisfy him concerning all
 his demands” on his arrival, if the Scot king would keep the peace till
 then.[273] Immediately after his coronation John despatched two envoys
 to summon William to his court and conduct him safely thither. After
 they had started, there came to the English king three envoys from
 Scotland with a repetition of William’s former message; but this time a
 threat was added; if William’s terms were not accepted “he would regain
 all that he was entitled to, if he could.” John answered quietly: “When
 your lord, my very dear cousin, shall come to me, I will do to him
 whatsoever is right concerning these things and other requests of his”;
 and he bade the bishop of Durham go to meet the Scot king, “hoping the
 latter would come according to his summons.”[274] He had himself left
 London on the morrow of his crowning {May 28} to go on pilgrimage to
 S. Albans;[275] he afterwards visited Canterbury and S. Edmunds,[276]
 and thence went to Northampton, to keep Whitsuntide (June 6) and wait
 for William.[277] He waited in vain; William only sent back the English
 envoys, reiterated his demand for the two counties and his threat of
 winning them by force, and added a further demand for an answer within
 forty days. John meanwhile had lost patience with him, had given the
 two counties in charge to a new sheriff, and started for the south
 on his way back to Normandy. The Scot king’s messengers followed him
 to the sea;[278] whether they overtook him is not clear; at any rate
 nothing came of their mission, and on Sunday, June 20, John sailed
 from Shoreham for Dieppe,[279] “taking with him a very great host from
 England.”[280]
 
 Within three days John and Philip met in conference at Gaillon. They
 came to no agreement, and John “made up his mind to resist the French
 king like a man, and to fight manfully for the peace of his country.”
 It is clear that his preparations were well in train before the meeting
 took place. Philip indeed made the first hostile movement by laying
 siege to the castle of Gaillon; not only, however, was he driven away
 by the troops who had come over with John,[281] but horse and foot
 came flocking to the muster at Rouen, though it was fixed for June 24,
 only four days after John’s landing. On that day he made a truce with
 Philip to last till August 16,[282] thus gaining nearly two months
 in which to mature his plans and increase his forces. He spent the
 greater part of this time in a progress through eastern Normandy, and,
 as the sequel showed, in negotiations with the counts of Flanders
 and Boulogne. On August 10 he was again at Rouen.[283] On the 13th
 Baldwin of Flanders came to him there “and became his man.”[284] On the
 16th, when the truce expired, representatives of the two kings met in
 conference between Gouleton and Boutavant; on the 18th Philip and John
 met in person. Philip was asked “why he so hated the king of England,
 who had never done him any harm?” He answered that John had occupied
 Normandy and other lands without his leave, whereas he ought first to
 have applied to his overlord for confirmation of his rights as heir,
 and done homage to him. Now, Philip demanded of John the surrender of
 the whole Vexin to the Crown of France, and that of Poitou, Anjou,
 Touraine, and Maine to himself as overlord, that he might transfer them
 to Arthur.[285]
 
 The Vexin had been a bone of contention between France and Normandy
 for nearly forty years, and its cession had been distinctly promised
 by Richard to Philip in 1195. As for the Angevin heritage, John in
 taking possession of it without waiting for investiture had only
 followed the example of his predecessor. Richard had made pecuniary
 amends to Philip for this irregular proceeding, which in feudal law
 was punishable--theoretically--by forfeiture. In his demand that
 John should resign the three Angevin counties, therefore, and in his
 previous grant of their investiture to Arthur, Philip did not exceed
 his legal rights. With regard to Poitou the case was more complicated.
 On the one hand, it is certain that at some time between Richard’s
 death and the middle of May 1200 Eleanor and John made an agreement in
 legal form, whereby John granted his mother to have and to hold all the
 days of her life, or during her pleasure, the whole of Poitou with all
 its appurtenances, she having first ceded and surrendered it to him “as
 her right heir,” received his homage for it, and made over to him the
 rights of government throughout the county and the fealty and services
 of its vassals.[286] On the other hand, at the end of June 1199 Eleanor
 had met Philip at Tours, and he had allowed her to do him homage for
 Poitou,[287] thus formally recognizing her as its lawful countess.
 Whatever be the precise date of the first-mentioned transaction,
 therefore, it seems that Eleanor, and Eleanor alone, was the person
 legally answerable for Poitou to the king of France at this moment.
 
 The English historian of the conference adds that Philip further made
 of John “other demands which the king of England would in no wise
 grant, nor was it right that he should grant them.” What these were
 he does not state; but it seems that some of the French nobles were
 of his opinion as to their character, for when the meeting broke up,
 “such of the counts and barons of the realm of France as had been in
 alliance with King Richard” came to John offered him their homage,
 and made offensive and defensive alliance with him against their own
 sovereign.[288] In the case of the count of Boulogne this alliance was
 embodied in a written treaty, drawn up on the same day (August 18) at
 “the castle on the Rock of Andely.”[289]
 
 In September Philip recommenced hostilities with the seizure of
 Conches.[290] John, who had continued hovering about eastern Normandy
 until then, at once struck southward; from September 12 to 17 he was
 at Bourg-le-Roi in Maine.[291] This movement of John’s apparently
 drew Philip southward after him; the next place which the French
 king attacked was the Cenomannian fortress of Ballon, held for John
 by one of his father’s most devoted adherents, Geoffrey of Brullon.
 The castle was taken, and Philip proceeded to raze it. William des
 Roches, the constable of Britanny, protested against this as contrary
 to the agreement between Arthur and the king. Philip retorted that
 he should deal with his own conquests as he pleased, without regard
 to Arthur.[292] On that very night--it must have been September
 17--William des Roches went to Bourg-le-Roi,[293] begged for a private
 interview with John, and undertook to make Arthur, Constance, and all
 Anjou, Maine and Poitou submit to him “so that all should be good
 friends together,” in return for an oath on John’s part that he would
 “do with them according to his (William’s) counsel.”[294] A written
 record of John’s promise to abide by the terms which William and
 other “lawful knights” of Normandy and Britanny--whom William was to
 choose--should arrange for peace between himself and his “very dear
 nephew Arthur,” “for the honour and advantage of us both,” was drawn up
 before witnesses on September 18 at Anvers-le-Hamon.
