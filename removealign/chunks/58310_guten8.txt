 In
 the spring of 1207 William the Marshal asked leave of John to visit
 his Irish lands, which he had never yet seen. The leave was given,
 though unwillingly; but as William was on the point of setting out
 from Striguil, he was overtaken by a message from the king, bidding him
 either remain in England, or give his second son as a hostage. William
 sent the boy back with the messenger, saying that the king might have
 all his children as hostages if he pleased,[654] but as for himself,
 he was determined to go to Ireland; and next day he sailed. His coming
 was far from welcome to the justiciar, who till then had been without a
 superior in the country, and who resented alike the necessity of doing
 homage to the Marshal for the land which he held under him, and the
 probability of his own importance being overshadowed by the presence of
 a man whose territorial and personal weight was so much greater than
 his own. Meiler therefore wrote to the king urging him to recall the
 Marshal. John did so, but bade Meiler himself come over at the same
 time. The Marshal, though feeling that mischief was in prospect, obeyed
 the king’s summons with his usual readiness, and returned to England at
 Michaelmas, leaving his wife with a band of trusty followers to defend
 Leinster in his stead. Meiler also came, after secretly bidding his
 kinsmen and friends attack the Marshal’s lands as soon as he was gone,
 which they did the very next week. The king gave Meiler a warm welcome,
 but treated the Marshal with coldness and displeasure,[655] which
 Meiler soon found a way to increase.
 
 At the beginning of the year the justiciar had seized for the Crown
 some of the lands, men and goods of William de Braose.[656] His
 excuse for this proceeding was probably the fact that De Braose was
 in debt to the Crown for the ferm of the city of Limerick, and also
 for no less than four thousand two hundred and ninety-eight marks of
 the five thousand which he had in January 1201 covenanted to pay, by
 instalments of five hundred every year, for the grant of the honour
 of Limerick.[657] Meiler, however, had acted without instructions
 from the king; and when De Braose complained of the treatment which
 he had received, John declared {1207 Feb. 12} that he “found no fault
 in him,” and bade Meiler restore everything that had been taken from
 him, unless indeed the city of Limerick was included; if that had been
 seized for the Crown, Meiler was to retain it till further orders.[658]
 The mingled feelings of the king are reflected in his letter. John had
 found in William de Braose a useful servant and friend; he knew that
 he might find in him a dangerous enemy; he was therefore reluctant to
 take any measures which might drive William into opposition. On the
 other hand, William’s neglect of his pecuniary obligations to the Crown
 had reached such a pass that it could hardly be ignored much longer;
 and William was further suspected of being in secret alliance against
 the king, both with the Welsh and with the De Lacys.[659] Of this
 suspicion the king seems to have known nothing till after the middle of
 July, when he reappointed “our beloved and faithful William de Braose”
 custodian of Ludlow Castle.[660] It had, however, reached his ears by
 the time of Meiler’s coming to England, and Meiler turned it to account
 for a double purpose of his own. One day, as the king and his chief
 counsellors sat talking together after dinner, something was said about
 William the Marshal and his friendly relations with William de Braose.
 Meiler wrought upon the king’s jealousy of the one and his suspicions
 of the other, till he persuaded him to join in a plot for bringing them
 both to ruin.
 
 [Sidenote: 1207–08]
 
 At the justiciar’s instigation John secretly despatched letters to all
 those of the Marshal’s followers in Ireland who held lands in England,
 bidding them, on pain of forfeiting these, to be at his court within a
 fortnight. At the same time Meiler, with the king’s licence, returned
 to Ireland. The Marshal asked permission to do the same; but this
 was refused. Meiler on his arrival found that hitherto his men had,
 on the whole, been worsted in their strife with those of Leinster. He
 now summoned the Marshal’s men to a “parliament,” at which the king’s
 messenger read out the secret letters. The men to whom these letters
 were addressed saw but too plainly what would be the result of their
 obedience: the Marshal’s lands would be left without defence against
 Meiler. They unanimously resolved to sacrifice their own English
 estates, disobey the king for their lord’s sake, and resist Meiler to
 the uttermost; and with the help of two powerful neighbours whom they
 called to their aid, Ralph Fitz-Payne and Hugh de Lacy, they succeeded,
 as one of them says, in doing to Meiler as much mischief as he had
 thought to do to their lord.[661] The Marshal, meanwhile, was compelled
 to remain at court, but so discountenanced by the king that hardly
 any one dared to speak to him. At last, one winter day, as they rode
 out from Guildford,[662] John called to him: “Marshal, have you had
 any news from Ireland that pleases you?” “No, sire.” “I can tell you
 some news,” said the king, laughing; and he told him that his wife,
 the Countess Isabel, had been besieged in Kilkenny by Meiler, who had
 indeed been at length worsted and even captured by her people, but with
 very heavy losses on her side, three of the Marshal’s chief friends
 being among the slain. The story was a sheer invention of John’s; in
 reality he had received no news from Ireland at all. The Marshal,
 though perplexed and troubled, retained his outward composure; and
 early in the spring he himself received from Ireland a very different
 account of what had happened there. The justiciar had not only been
 captured, but had made submission to the countess and given his son as
 a hostage till he himself should stand to right in her husband’s court
 for the wrong which he had done to him as his lord.
 
 [Sidenote: 1208–09]
 
 These tidings were sent at the same time to the king, who was by no
 means pleased with them, but characteristically changed his policy
 at once to meet the turn of the tide. He called the Marshal to his
 presence, greeted him with unusual courtesy, and asked him if he had
 heard anything from Ireland. “No, sire; I have no news from thence.”
 “Then I will tell you some good news, of which I wish you joy”--and
 thereupon John related the truth, which William knew already, though he
 had not chosen to say so. From that time forth “the king made him as
 good cheer as he had made him evil cheer before”; and when the Marshal
 soon afterwards again asked leave to go to Ireland, it was granted at
 once.[663] On March 7 Meiler was ordered to refrain from interfering
 with the lands of the Marshal, who had instructed his men to keep the
 peace towards Meiler in return;[664] on March 20 John informed the
 justiciar that “the Marshal has done our will,” and despatched to
 Ireland four commissioners by whose instructions Meiler was to act, and
 who, if he failed to do so, were empowered to act in his stead.[665] On
 the 28th, a new grant of Leinster, on the terms of the original grant
 to Richard de Clare, was made by the king to the Marshal.[666] A month
 later Meath was in like manner granted afresh to Walter de Lacy;[667]
 and at the end of the next year, 1209, Meiler was removed from his
 office of justiciar, and replaced by the bishop of Norwich, John de
 Grey.[668]
 
 [Sidenote: 1208]
 
 On one point, however, Meiler was justified by the king. In the spring
 of 1208 John made up his mind to bear with William de Braose no
 longer, and ordered a distraint upon his Welsh lands. William’s wife,
 Maud of Saint-Valery,[669] his nephew, Earl William of Ferrars, and
 his sister’s husband, Adam de Port, met the king at Gloucester and
 persuaded him to grant an interview to William himself at Hereford.
 William promised to pay his debts to the treasury within a certain
 time, pledged some of his castles for the payment, and gave three
 of his grandsons and four other persons as hostages.[670] Roger of
 Wendover relates that when the king’s officers went to fetch the
 hostages, Maud refused to deliver up her grandchildren to the king,
 “because,” said she, “he has murdered his captive nephew”; that her
 husband reproved her, and declared himself willing to answer according
 to law for anything in which he had offended the king; and that John,
 on hearing what Maud had said, was “greatly perturbed,” and ordered
 the whole family of De Braose to be arrested.[671] John himself, in a
 public statement attested by the chief justiciar of England and twelve
 other men of high position, among whom were De Braose’s own nephew and
 brother-in-law, asserted that shortly after the meeting at Hereford
 De Braose and his sons attempted to regain the pledged castles by
 force, and when they had failed in this attempt, attacked and burned
 Leominster.[672] Thereupon it seems that William was proclaimed a
 traitor; on September 21 John empowered Gerald of Athies to make an
 agreement with all who were or had been homagers of William de Braose,
 so that they should “come to the king’s service and not return to the
 service of William.”[673]

 [Sidenote: 1209–10]
 
 De Braose was chased by the king’s officers,[674] till in the following
 year, 1209, he escaped, with his wife and two of their sons, from
 some Welsh seaport, intending to go to Ireland. A violent storm kept
 them tossing on the sea for three days and three nights; at last
 they landed at Wicklow. William the Marshal chanced to be there; he
 received them kindly and sheltered them for three weeks. Then their
 presence was discovered by the new justiciar, Bishop John de Grey,
 who at once taxed the Marshal with harbouring “the king’s traitors,”
 and bade him give them up to justice. The Marshal refused, saying he
 had only received “his lord,”[675] as he was bound to do, and without
 knowing that De Braose had incurred the king’s displeasure; and he
 added that he himself would not act like a traitor towards De Braose
 at the justiciar’s bidding. Thereupon he sent the refugees safely on
 to their destination, the home of De Braose’s son-in-law, Walter de
 Lacy. The justiciar complained to the king, who summoned his host for
 an expedition to Ireland;[676] both the Marshal and the Lacys having
 positively refused to give up De Braose, though they offered to be
 answerable for his going to England to satisfy the king within a fixed
 time, and promised that, if he failed to do so, they would then harbour
 him no more. At last--seemingly in the spring of 1210--De Braose was
 allowed to go on these conditions back to Wales. John had apparently
 consented to meet him at Hereford; but when De Braose reached Hereford,
 “he,” says the king, “regarded us not,” but began to collect all the
 forces he could muster against the Crown. His nephew, the earl of
 Ferrars, however, managed to bring him to a meeting with the king at
 Pembroke. He offered a fine of forty thousand marks. “We,” says John,
 “told him we knew well that he was not in his own power at all, but in
 that of his wife, who was in Ireland; and we proposed that he should
 go to Ireland with us, and the matter should be settled there; but he
 chose rather to remain in Wales,”[677] and was suffered to do so--John
 being determined now to settle matters not only with Maud de Braose,
 but with all the barons of the Irish March, according to his own will
 and pleasure.
 
 At some date between June 16 and 20 John crossed from Pembroke to
 Crook, near Waterford. Thence he proceeded by way of Newbridge and
 Thomastown to Kilkenny, where he and all his host were received and
 entertained for two days (June 23 and 24) by William the Marshal.[678]
 On June 28 the king reached Dublin; thence he led his host into
 Meath.[679] Walter de Lacy and the De Braoses fled, evidently into
 Ulster; thither John marched in pursuit of them, but before he could
 overtake them they had escaped over sea into Galloway.[680] Hugh
 de Lacy had retired into the stronghold of Carrickfergus; at the
 king’s approach, however, he, too, slipped away in a little boat to
 Scotland.[681] Carrickfergus was provisioned for a siege, but its
 garrison was soon frightened into surrender.[682] While John was at
 Carrickfergus, his “friend and cousin,” Duncan of Carrick, sent him
 word that he had captured Maud de Braose, one of her daughters, her
 eldest son, his wife and their two children; her younger son, Reginald,
 had escaped, and so had the Lacys. The king despatched John de Courcy
 (whom he had taken back into favour, and brought with him to Ireland,
 as likely to be a willing and useful helper against the De Lacys) to
 fetch the captives from Galloway. When they were brought before him,
 Maud offered the surrender of all her husband’s lands and a fine of
 forty thousand marks, which John accepted; but three days later she
 repudiated her agreement.[683] Taking his prisoners with him, the king
 turned southward again, and soon completed the subjugation of the
 Lacys’ territories. Most of the lesser barons fled before him as their
 lords had done, “fearing to fall into his hands.”[684] A week’s stay
 in Dublin (August 18 to 24) brought his expedition to a close.[685]
 
 [Sidenote: 1210]
 
 It was probably during this second stay of John’s at Dublin that, as
 Roger of Wendover says, “there came to him there more than twenty
 kinglets[686] of that country, who all, terrified with a very great
 fear, did him homage and fealty; yet a few kinglets neglected to come,
 who scorned to do so, because they dwelt in impregnable places. Also
 he caused to be set up there English laws and customs, establishing
 sheriffs and other officers who should judge the people of that realm
 according to English laws.”[687] This latter statement of Roger’s may
 have given rise to the later belief that it was John who organized
 the administration of the March in Ireland after the English model,
 by dividing the whole of the conquered territory into counties, each
 under its own sheriff.[688] It appears, however, that there were
 sheriffs in Ireland in the days of Henry II.[689] The earliest known
 mention of a sheriff’s district there occurs in 1205, when we hear of
 the “county of Waterford.”[690] Ten years later the same county is
 mentioned again, and also that of Cork;[691] and before the end of
 the century ten counties, at least, were recognized by the English
 government in Ireland.[692] The names of the earliest Irish counties
 thus known to us and the circumstances of John’s visit to Ireland in
 1210 may suggest a clue to the rise and growth of the shire-system in
 that country. The district which forms the present county of Waterford
 had never been enfeoffed either by Henry II. or by John, but remained
 directly in the hands of the supreme ruler of the March. Of the present
 county Cork, the eastern half, at least, escheated together with the
 rest of Raymond FitzGerald’s share of the “kingdom of Cork” on his
 death about 1185. No notice of a new enfeoffment of any of the lands
 which had been his occurs till 1208, and then they were not granted
 as a whole; so far as we know, only a portion of them was enfeoffed,
 and that portion was distributed among several feoffees.[693] It seems
 probable that the system of county administration may have been first
 established in Ireland in those districts which were under the direct
 rule of the English Crown (or, to speak more exactly, of the “English,”
 or Angevin, “Lord of Ireland”), and of which the continuous extent was
 too great for them to be left, like the single cantreds attached to the
 other seaport towns, under the control of a mere military governor or
 constable, and that it was only by degrees introduced into the great
 fiefs. If this were so, the events of 1210 would furnish an excellent
 opportunity for its extension. Of the four great fiefs which, together
 with the royal domains and the lately redistributed honour of Cork,
 made up the “English” March in Ireland, Leinster was, when John sailed
 from Dublin for England at the end of August,[694] practically the only
 one left. Meath, Ulster, and Limerick were all forfeit to the Crown;
 and the Crown kept the greater part of them for many years after. Meath
 was not restored to Walter de Lacy till 1215;[695] Walter’s brother,
 the earl of Ulster, did not return from exile till after John’s
 death;[696] and the honour of Limerick was never again bestowed as
 a whole upon a single grantee. Under these circumstances a system of
 administrative division into counties placed under sheriffs appointed
 by the king, or by the justiciar in his name, might be established
 without difficulty in territories where its introduction in earlier
 years, if ever attempted, would probably have been rendered ineffectual
 by the power of the great barons. The one great baron who in the autumn
 of 1210 still held his ground in the March--Earl William the Marshal,
 the lord of Leinster--had no hesitation in withstanding the king to
 his face in the cause of honour and justice; but he was not a man to
 throw obstacles in the way of the royal authority when it was exercised
 within the sphere of its rights and in the interest of public order.
 
 On the king’s return to Dublin William the Marshal came to the court.
 John at once accused him of having “harboured a traitor” in the person
 of William de Braose. The Marshal answered the king as he had answered
 the justiciar, and added that if any other man dared to utter such a
 charge against him, he was ready to disprove it there and then. As
 usual, no one would take up his challenge; nevertheless, John again
 required hostages and pledges for the Marshal’s fidelity, and again
 they were given at once.[697] Meanwhile, the sheriff of Hereford sent
 word that William de Braose was stirring up trouble in Wales, and
 urged that he should be outlawed; but the king ordered that the matter
 should await his own return to England. When he was about to sail, Maud
 de Braose offered to fine with him for forty thousand marks, and ten
 thousand in addition, as amends for having withdrawn from her former
 agreement. John accepted these terms; the fine was signed and sealed,
 and it was agreed that Maud, and also, it seems, the other members of
 her family who had been captured with her, should remain in custody
 till it was paid. John carried his prisoners back with him to England,
 put Maud in prison at Bristol, and at her request gave an audience
 to her husband, who ratified the fine which she had made, but fled
 secretly just before the day fixed for paying the first instalment.
 The king asked Maud what she now proposed to do, and she answered
 plainly that she had no intention, and no means, of paying. Then it was
 ordered that “the judgement of our realm should be carried out against
 William,” and he was outlawed.[698] Thus far the king tells his own
 story, and there is no reason to doubt its truth. What he does not
 tell is the end of the story. He sent Maud and her son to a dungeon at
 Windsor, and there starved them to death.[699]

 holding lands of ecclesiastical superiors (cf. _Rot. Claus._ vol. i. p.

 John, it seems, had not yet abandoned all hope of getting something
 from the beneficed clergy; on May 26 he asked those of the southern

 of the interdict March the _Ann. Winton._ date it “Monday in Passion

 make it Passion Sunday, _i.e._ March 23, which is the date given by
 R. Wendover (iii. 222), W. Coventry (ii. 199) and T. Wykes (a. 1207).
 Roger of Wendover, however, adds that it was the Monday in Passion
 Week, so his dates are self-contradictory.
 
 [542] R. Coggeshall, p. 163, says the general confiscation of clerical
 property took place on March 24; and the king’s orders (issued March 17
 and 18) for the seizure of the sees of Bath and Ely are to take effect
 from that day (_Rot. Pat._ vol. i. p. 80, 80 b), which looks as if the
 confiscation was meant to be an immediate retort to the interdict. But
 the see of Norwich--though its bishop was the king’s favourite John de
 Grey--was evidently seized before March 23 (_ib._ p. 81); while the
 sheriffs of Derbyshire and Warwickshire were already holding for the
 king “all the manors of the bishop of Chester within their bailiwicks,
 and everything in them, and all the lands and goods of abbots, priors,
 religious, and clerks, within their bailiwicks,” as early as March
 21, for on that day they were ordered to hand them over to another
 custodian. _Rot. Claus._ vol. i. p. 107.

 of the state of public feeling on the question between John and the
 Pope: “Electus est Magister S. de Langetone ad archiepiscopatum
 Cantuariensem.... Pro cujus electione, quia facta fuit contra profanas
 illas consuetudines quas vocant avitas leges et regias libertates,
 orta est statim discordia inter Papam Innocentium et Johannem
 tyrannum Angliae, faventibus _ei_” (Stephen, Innocent, or John?) “et
 consentientibus omnibus laicis et clericis fere universis, sed et viris
 cujuslibet professionis multis.”

 [549] John proposed, instead of himself giving Langton the regalia of
 the see, to place them in the Pope’s hands and let him confer them
 on the archbishop, inasmuch as John “could not yet bring himself to
 receive Stephen as a friend.” The Pope, though he did not like the
 scheme, yet authorized the bishops of London, Ely and Worcester to
 receive the regalia as his representatives and to confer them as the
 king desired; but whenever the bishops sought an interview with the
 king on the subject, he put them off. At last, in September (1208), he
 gave Langton himself a safe-conduct for a week’s visit to England, but
 addressed it to “S. de Langton, Cardinal,” thus showing that he did not
 yet intend to recognize him as archbishop. Langton of course declined
 to come on such terms. See Innoc. III. _Epp._ l. xi. Nos. 89, 90; _Rot.
 Pat._ vol. i. pp. 82, 85, 86; _Ann. Waverl._ a. 1208.

 _Dunst._ a. 1208. All the chroniclers have confused the dates, which
 have to be rectified by the help of the Pope’s letters, the Patent
 and Close Rolls (both of which, however, unluckily fail in 1209), and
 Bishop Stubbs’s notes to Gerv. Cant. vol. ii. pp. 103, 104, appendix
 to preface, _ib._ pp. xci.–cviii., and W. Coventry, vol. ii. preface,
 pp. lv., lvi. The sees of Chichester, Exeter, Lincoln and Durham were
 vacant; before June 21, 1209, Hugh of Wells was elected to Lincoln
 by desire of the king, who sent him to Normandy to be consecrated by
 the archbishop of Rouen, but he went to the archbishop of Canterbury
 instead, and was consecrated by him on December 20 (R. Wendover, vol.
 iii. p. 231; date from M. Paris, _Hist. Angl._ vol. ii. p. 120, note
 4). Carlisle had been administered since 1203 by Bernard, the exiled
 archbishop of Ragusa. Coventry (or Chester) was vacated in October 1208
 by the death of Geoffrey Muschamp, who is mentioned by Gervase among
 the bishops who went over sea.

 [553] The two best known instances indeed are of doubtful authenticity;
 see Note II. at end. But the general charge against John rests upon
 authorities which there is no reason to question; _Hist. des Ducs_,
 pp. 105, 200, and R. Wendover, vol. iii. p. 240. The list of John’s
 children given by Pauli, _Gesch. von England_, vol. iii. p. 475, is

 probably wrong, but there is no means of deciding which.

 marks; the document in _Foedera_ is the best authority, although its

 its date, “_Northampton_, 7th August,” being of course a transcriber’s

 imagined; the princes of both North and South Wales had done homage to
 Henry II. at Oxford in 1177. The chroniclers’ expressions about this
 Welsh homage to John, however, show the impression which it made and
 the importance which was attached to it.

 de Braose, had promised that he would never give, sell, or pledge any
 part of his land in England or Normandy without his father-in-law’s
 consent; and this engagement had been embodied in a charter and
 confirmed by the king. _Rot. Obl._ (a. 2 Joh.), p. 81. One of its
 results seems to have been that De Braose took charge of Ludlow Castle;
 it was he who on March 5, 1206, was summoned to deliver it up to Philip
 d’Aubigné for the king; _Rot. Pat._ p. 69 b. On July 13, 1207, John
 transferred its custody from D’Aubigné back to De Braose.

 [668] The bishop of Norwich was in Ireland before January 2, 1210
 (_Rot. Misæ_, p. 144); Meiler had ceased to be justiciar before
 February 16 of the same year (_ib._ p. 149); and the bishop was in
 office as justiciar when the De Braoses arrived in Ireland towards the
 end of 1209, as appears from _Hist. de G. le Mar._ vv. 14119–172. The
 Four Masters’ account of Bishop John’s appointment and its consequences
 is too amusing to be omitted. They say under the year 1208: “John,
 bishop of Norwich, was sent by the king of England into Ireland as lord
 justice; and the English were excommunicated by the successor of S.
 Peter for sending the bishop to carry on war in Ireland.”
 
 [669] The king speaks of her as Maud de la Haye, _Foedera_, vol. i. pt.
