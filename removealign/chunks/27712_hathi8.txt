receiving that message, both his wife and daughter

went to him; but as yet he could tell them nothing.

Tidings had come which would make it necessary that

he should go at once to London. As soon as break-

fast should be over he would see George Hotspur.

They both knew from the tone in which the name

was pronounced that the “tidings" were of their nature

bad, and that they had reference to the sins of their

guest.

“Shall I not say a word of adieu to Lady Elizabeth?”

“No, sir! You shall never speak to a female in

my house again.”

The two were driven over to Penrith together, and

went up to London in the same carriage, Sir Harry

paying for all expenses without a word. Sir Harry

before he left his house saw his wife for a moment,

but he did not see his daughter. “Tell her," said

he, “that it must be,-must be all over." The de-

cision was told to Emily, but she simply refused to

accept it. “It shall not be so," said she, flashing out.

Lady Elizabeth endeavoured to show her that her father

had done all he could to further her views-had been

ready to sacrifice to her all his own wishes and con-

victions.

“Why is he so changed? He has heard of some

new debt. Of course there are debts. We did not

easily.” She refused to be comforted, and refused to

mother that should it turn out that he had been a

She did not know that cheating at cards was worse

than betting at horse-races. It was all bad, -very bad.

It was the kind of life into which men were led by

the fault of those who should have taught them better.

No; she would not marry him without her father's

leave: but she would never own that her engagement

was broken, let them affix what most opprobrious name

to him they might choose. To her card-sharpers seemed

to be no worse than gamblers. She was quite sure

that Christ had come to save men who cheat at cards

as well as others.

; As Sir Harry and his cousin entered the London

station late at night,-it was past midnight, Sir Harry

bade his companion meet him the next morning at

Mr. Boltby's chambers at eleven. Cousin George had

had ample time for meditation, and had considered

that it might be best for him to cut up a little rough.".

“Mr. Boltby is my enemy," he said, “and I don't

"If you don't, sir, I'll not pay one shilling for you."

“I have your promise, Sir Harry."

“If you are not there at the time I fix, I will pay

nothing, and the name may go to the dogs.".

Cousin George was sitting in Mrs. Morton's room

with a very bad headache five days after his arrival

in London, and she was reading over a manuscript

which she had just written. “That will do, I think,”

she said.

“Just the thing," said he, without raising his head.

“Will you copy it now, George?”

“Not just now, I am so seedy. I'll take it and do

it at the club.”

“No; I will not have that. The draft would cer-

tainly be left out on the club table; and you would go

to billiards, and the letter never would be written.”

“I'll come back and do it after dinner.”

“I shall be at the theatre then, and I won't have

you here in my absence. Rouse yourself and do it

now. Don't be such a poor thing."

“That's all very well, Lucy; but if you had a sick

headache, you wouldn't like to have to write a

Then she rose up to scold him, being determined

that the letter should be written then and there.

be written at once if it is to be written.” Then he

turned himself wearily to her writing-desk, and copied

the words which she had prepared for him.

The letter was addressed to Mr. Boltby, and pur-

ported to be a renunciation of all claim to Miss Hot-

spur's hand, on the understanding that his debts were

paid for him to the extent of 25,000l., and that an

allowance were made to him of 500l. a year, settled

on him as an annuity for life, as long as he should

live out of England. Mr. Boltby had given him to

understand that this clause would not be exacted,

unless circumstances should arise which should make

Sir Harry think it imperative upon him to demand its

execution. The discretion must be left absolute with

Sir Harry; but, as Mr. Boltby said, Captain Hotspur

could trust Sir Harry's word and his honour.

"If I'm to be made to go abroad, what the devil

are you to do?” he had said to Mrs. Morton..

. “There need be no circumstances,” said Mrs. Mor-

ton, “to make it necessary.” **

Of course Captain Hotspur accepted the terms on

her advice. He had obeyed Lady Altringham, and

had tried to obey Emily, and would now obey Mrs.

Morton, because Mrs. Morton was the nearest to him.

“I've a good mind to come and see you," said he.

“Then you'd better go and eat your own dinner

“I don't care about my dinner. I should have a

Then she preached to him a sermon; not quite

such a one as Emily Hotspur had preached, but much

more practical, and with less reticence. 'If he went on

that he could not do so with impunity. Did he know

what delirium tremens was? Did he want to go to

“Yes,” said he, “I hope to make you my wife.”

She tossed her head, and told him that with all the

could do him no good if he persisted in making him-

SIR HARRY HOTSPUR returned to Humblethwaite

before Cousin George's letter was written, though when

he did return all the terms had been arranged, and a

portion of the money paid. Perhaps it would have

been better that he should have waited and taken the

letter with him in his pocket; but in truth he was so

wretched that he could not wait. The thing was fixed

and done, and he could but hurry home to hide his

face among his own people. He felt that the glory of

his house was gone from him. He would sit by the

hour together thinking of the boy who had died. He

had almost, on occasions, allowed himself to forget his

boy, while hoping that his name and wide domains

might be kept together by the girl that was left to him.

He was beginning to understand now that she was

already but little better than a wreck. Indeed, was

not everything shipwreck around him? Was he not

guilt, and why tell her of it any further? Did she not

pine over his guilt, and weep for it day and night,

and pray that he might yet be made white as snow?

But guilty as he was, a poor piece of broken vilest

clay, without the properties even which are useful to

the potter, he was as dear to her as when she had

leaned against him believing him to be a pillar of

gold set about with onyx stones, jaspers, and rubies.

There was but one sin on his part which could divide

them. If, indeed, he should cease to love her, then

there would be an end to it! It would have been

better that Sir Harry should have remained in London

till he could have returned with George's autograph

letter in his pocket.

“You must have the letter in his own handwriting,"

Mr. Boltby had said, cunningly, “only you must return

it to me.”

Sir Harry had understood, and had promised, that

the letter should be returned when it had been used

for the cruel purpose for which it was to be sent to

Humblethwaite. For all Sir Harry's own purposes Mr.

Boltby's statements would have quite sufficed.

hither and thither in a way that she herself felt to be

mediator with her father on behalf of the wicked

cousin, she again assented. And then, when she was

alone with Sir Harry, she did not dare to do as she

had promised.

“I do think it will kill her,” she said to Sir Harry.

“We must all die, but we need not die disgraced,”

he said.

It was a most solemn answer, and told the thoughts

which had been dwelling in his mind. His son hadi

gone from him; and now it might be that his daughter

must go too, because she could not survive the dis-

appointment of her young love. He had learned to

think that it might be so as he looked at her great

grave eyes, and her pale cheeks, and her sorrow-laden

mouth. It might be so; but better that for them all

than that she should be contaminated by the touch of

a thing so vile as this cousin. She was pure as snow,

. clear as a star, lovely as the opening rosebud. As she

was, let her go to her grave,-if it need be so. For

himself, he could die too,mor even live if it were

required of him! Other fathers, since Jephtha and

“Not in the least. It is his own handwriting and

him, he sent for her, and read it to her. She heard it

without a word. Then he put it into her hands, and

she read the sentences herself, slowly, one after

another, endeavouring as she did so to find arguments

by which she might stave off the conclusion to

which she knew that her father would attempt to bring

her.

"It must be all over now," said he at last.

She did not answer him, but gazed into his face

with such a look of woe that his heart was melted.

She had found no argument. There had not been in

the whole letter one word of love for her.

“My darling, will it not be better that we should

meet the blow?”

“I have met it, all along. Some day, perhaps, he

might be different.”

“In what way, dearest? He does not even profess

to hope so himself.”

On the following morning she was at breakfast, and

both her father and mother remarked that something

had been changed in her dress. The father only knew

that it was so, but the mother could have told of every

ribbon that had been dropped, and every ornament that

had been laid aside. Emily Hotspur had lived a while,

if not among the gayest of the gay, at least among the

brightest of the bright in outside garniture, and having

been asked to consult no questions of expense, had

taught herself to dress as do the gay and bright and

rich. Even when George had come on his last

wretched visit to Humblethwaite, when she had known

that he had been brought there as a blackamoor per-

haps just capable of being washed white, she had not

thought it necessary to lessen the gauds of her attire.

Though she was saddened in her joy by the knowledge

of the man's faults, she was still the rich daughter of

a very wealthy man, and engaged to marry the future

inheritor of all that wealth and riches. There was then

no reason why she should lower her flag one inch be-

fore the world. But now all was changed with her!

During the night she had thought of her apparel, and

of what use it might be during her future life. She

would never more go bright again, unless some miracle

might prevail, and he still might be to her that which

she had painted him. Neither father nor mother, as

ledging to herself the necessity of her pledge to him.

He had never loved her; and, though she did not say

hiso, did not think so, she felt that of all his sins that

sin was the one which could not be forgiven.

What should she now do with herself,-how bear

herself at this present moment of her life? She did

not tell herself now that she would die, though as she

looked forward into life all was so dreary to her, that

she would fain have known that death would give an

escape. But there were duties for her still to do.

During that winter ramble, she owned to herself for the

first time that her father had been right in his judgment

respecting their cousin, and that she, by her pertina-

city, had driven her father on till on her account he

had been forced into conduct which was distasteful to

him. She must own to her father that he had been

right; that the man, though she dearly loved him still,

was of such nature that it would be quite unfit that

she should marry him. There might still be the

miracle; her prayers were still her own to give; of them

she would say nothing to her father. She would

simply confess to him that he had been right, and then

beg of him to pardon her the trouble she had caused

him.

and she must be added to the list of women who

have sacrificed themselves on behalf of men whom

they have known to be worthless. We need not pursue

his career further; but we may be sure, that though

she watched him very closely, and used a power over

him of which he was afraid, still he went gradually

from bad to worse, and was found at last to be utterly

past redemption. He was one who in early life had

never known what it was to take delight in postpon-

ing himself to another; and now there was no spark

in him of love or gratitude by which fire could be

kindled or warmth created. It had come to that with

him,—that to eat and to drink was all that was left to

him; and it was coming to that too, that the latter of

these two pleasant recreations would soon be all that

he had within his power of enjoyment. There are

such men; and of all human beings they are the most

to be pitied. They have intellects; they do think; the

hours with them are terribly long;-and they have no

hope!

The Hotspurs of Humblethwaite remained at home

till Christmas was passed, and then at once started

for Rome. Sir Harry and Lady Elizabeth both felt

that it must be infinitely better for their girl to be

away; and then there came the doctor's slow advice.

spent her days among the poor, and when not with

dreary book in her hands when they were together in

the drawing-room after dinner. Of church-going and

visiting the poor, and of good books, Sir Harry ap-

proved thoroughly; but even of good things such as

these there may be too much. So Sir Harry and

Lady Elizabeth got a courier who spoke all languages,

and a footman who spoke German, and two maids, of

whom one pretended to speak French, and had trunks

packed without number, and started for Rome. All

that wealth could do was done; but let the horseman

In Rome they remained till April, and while they

were there the name of Cousin George was never

once mentioned in the hearing of Sir Harry. Be-

tween the mother and daughter no doubt there was

speech concerning him. But to Emily's mind he

was always present. He was to her as a thing

abominable, and yet necessarily tied to her by bonds

which she could never burst asunder. She felt like

some poor princess in a tale, married to an ogre from

whom there was no escape. She had given berself

up to one utterly worthless, and she knew it. But

a yet she had given herself, and could not revoke the

gift. There was, indeed, still left to her that possibility

(of a miracle, but of that she whispered nothing even

- to her mother. If there were to be a miracle, it must

be of God; and at God's throne she made her

whispers. In these days she was taken about from

sight to sight with apparent willingness. She saw

churches, pictures, statues, and ruins, and seemed to

take an interest in them. She was introduced to the

Pope, and allowed herself to be apparelled in her very

best for that august occasion. But, nevertheless, the

tenor of her way and the fashions of her life, as was

her daily dress, were grey and sad and solemn. She

lived as one who knew that the backbone of her life

the thought of that was gone. The man who had

made her believe that he loved her, only in the last
