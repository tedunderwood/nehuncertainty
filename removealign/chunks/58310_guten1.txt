[102] Whether this letter was genuine or
 forged, there is nothing to show; if such a proposition was really made
 by Henry, it was probably only as a temporary expedient for putting off
 Philip’s importunity on the awkward question of Adela’s marriage. In
 the autumn Henry and Richard were again reconciled,[103] and a little
 later both were for a moment reconciled to Philip by a common vow of
 crusade.
 
 [Sidenote: 1188–1189]
 
 On January 30, 1188, Henry returned to England, and it seems that John
 went with him; for when Philip attacked Berry again in the summer,
 Henry “sent into Normandy his son John, who crossed from Shoreham to
 Dieppe.”[104] The king rejoined his son in July, and they probably
 remained together during the greater part of the next eleven months,
 though there is no mention of John’s presence at any of the numerous
 conferences between Henry and Philip. At one of these conferences--that
 at La Ferté Bernard, on Trinity Sunday, June 4, 1189[105]--Philip and
 Richard demanded that John should be made to accompany his father
 and brother on the crusade; Richard even declared that he would not
 go himself unless John went too.[106] Henry, on the other hand, now
 openly proposed to Philip that Adela should marry John instead of
 Richard; but Philip, now that Richard was at his side, would not listen
 to this suggestion.[107]
 
 Our last glimpse of John during his father’s lifetime is at Le Mans
 on June 12, when Philip and Richard captured the city, and Henry was
 compelled to flee. A contemporary tells us that before setting out on
 his flight “the king caused his son John, whom he loved and in whom
 he greatly trusted, to be disarmed.”[108] This precaution may have
 been due to anxiety--groundless, as the issue proved--lest John should
 thrust himself into danger in his father’s behalf; that it was not
 suggested by any doubts of John’s loyalty is plain, not only from the
 words of the writer who records it, but also from Henry’s action on
 the next morning, when, before setting out on his solitary ride from
 La Frênaye back into Anjou, he despatched his remaining followers to
 Normandy, after making the seneschal of the duchy and Earl William
 de Mandeville swear that in case of his own death the Norman castles
 should be given up to John.[109] John, however, had then already left
 him--under what circumstances, or at what precise moment, we know
 not; but it seems clear that at some time between the French attack
 upon Le Mans on the Monday morning and Henry’s arrival at La Frênaye
 on the same night, John had either been sent away by his father for
 safety, or had found some pretext for quitting his company, and that,
 in either case, he used the opportunity to go his own way with such
 characteristic ingenuity that for three whole weeks his father never
 guessed whither that way really tended.[110]
 
 [Sidenote: 1189]
 
 Henry and Richard had been set at strife by an illusion of their own
 imaginations. Richard had been spurred to rebellion by the idea that
 his father aimed at disinheriting him in favour of John, and might
 succeed in that aim, unless prevented by force. Henry’s schemes for
 John were probably in reality much less definite and less outrageous
 than Richard imagined; but there can be little doubt that the otherwise
 unaccountable inconsistencies and self-contradictions, the seemingly
 wanton changes of front, by which the king in his latter years had
 so bewildered and exasperated his elder son, were the outcome of an
 insatiable desire to place John, somehow or other, in a more lofty and
 independent position than a younger son was fairly entitled to expect.
 The strange thing is that Henry never perceived how hopeless were his
 efforts, nor Richard how groundless were his fears; neither of them,
 apparently, realizing that the substitution of John for Richard as heir
 of the Angevin house was an idea which could not possibly be carried
 into effect. The utter selfishness of John, however, rendered him, mere
 lad of one-and-twenty as he was, proof against illusions where his own
 interest was concerned; and it was he who pricked the bubble. On July 4
 Henry, sick unto death, made his submission to Philip and Richard, and
 received a list of the traitors who had transferred their homage to the
 latter. That night, at Chinon, he bade his vice-chancellor read him the
 names. The vice-chancellor hesitated; the king insisted; at last the
 truth which was to give him his death-blow came out: “Sire, the first
 that is written down here is Lord John, your son.”[111]

 According to the writer of this last account, young Henry’s homage to
 Louis was only for Anjou and Maine, and he adds: “In hac autem honorum
 distributione Franci regno suo arbitrantur plurimum esse prospectum; eo
 quidem magis quod cum acerbiori dolore meminerant Henricum filium regis
 Angliæ regi Francorum pro omnibus hominium fecisse, quando inter ipsum
 et filiam regis Francorum sponsalia contracta sunt.” But R. Torigni’s
 account of young Henry’s homage to Louis in 1160, when compared with
 his account of the settlement in 1169, seems distinctly to imply that
 the former was for Normandy alone.

 [110] Gerald indeed (_l.c._) says: “In crastino vero ... versus
 Andegaviam rege properante, fidei tamen sacramentique vinculis
 senescallo Normanniae Guillelmo Radulphi filio et comite Guillelmo de
 Mandeville ante constrictis, de munitionibus Normanniae cunctis, siquid
 de ipso sinistrum fore contigerit, filio suo juniori Johanni reddendis,
 quanquam tamen et ipse ab eodem, proh dolor! paulo _post_ discesserit.”
 But it looks very much as if “post” here were a mistake for “ante,” for
 the whole story indicates that John was not at La Frênaye on the night
 of June 12. Cf. W. Newb. l. iii. c. 25: “Tunc” (after the flight from
 Le Mans) “Johannes filiorum ejus minimus, quem tenerrime diligebat,
 recessit ab eo”; and _Gesta Hen._ vol. ii. p. 72: “Johannes filius
 ejus, qui mortis suae occasio, immo causa praecipua fuerat, eo quod
 illum tempore guerrae, cum capta esset civitas Cenomannis, reliquerat.”
 These two writers, indeed, taken by themselves, would seem to imply
 that John’s desertion was open; but Henry’s charge to the two Norman
 barons, and his subsequent horror at the final discovery of John’s
 treason, indicate that it was managed with a refinement of duplicity
 which is really more in accord with John’s character.

 JOHN COUNT OF MORTAIN

 [Sidenote: 1189]
 
 On July 6 Henry died; on the 8th he was buried at Fontevraud. Richard
 attended the burial; John did not, but immediately afterwards, either
 at Fontevraud or on the way northward, he sought the presence of his
 brother. Richard received him graciously, and on reaching Normandy
 “granted him all the lands which his father had given him, to wit, four
 thousand pounds’ worth of lands in England, and the county of Mortain
 with its appurtenances.”[112] These words, and similar expressions used
 by two other writers of the time,[113] would seem to imply that John
 had been count of Mortain before Henry’s death, and that Richard merely
 confirmed to him a possession and a dignity which he already enjoyed.
 John, however, is never styled “count” during Henry’s lifetime;[114]
 and the real meaning of the historians seems to be that Henry had in
 his latter days reverted to his early project of making John count of
 Mortain, but had never carried it into effect, probably because he
 could not do so without Richard’s assent. Richard’s grant was thus an
 entirely new one, though made in fulfilment of his father’s desire.
 It set John in the foremost rank among the barons of Normandy, though
 the income which it brought him was not very large. The grant of lands
 in England, said to have been made to him at the same time, can only
 have been a promise; Richard was not yet crowned, and therefore not yet
 legally capable of granting anything in England at all. On his arrival
 there in August, one of his first acts was to secure the Gloucester
 heritage for John by causing him to be married to Isabel. The wedding
 took place at Marlborough on August 29.[115] Five days later the king
 was crowned; John figured at the coronation as “Earl of Mortain and
 Gloucester,” and walked before his brother in the procession, carrying
 one of the three swords of state, between Earl David of Huntingdon and
 Earl Robert of Leicester, who bore the other two swords.[116]
 
 At the end of the month, or early in October, Richard despatched John
 at the head of an armed force, to secure for the new king the homage of
 the Welsh princes. They all, save one, came to meet John at Worcester,
 and “made a treaty of peace” with him as his brother’s representative.
 The exception was Rees of South Wales, who was in active hostility to
 the English Crown,[117] being at that very time engaged in besieging
 Caermarthen castle. John led “the host of all England” to Caermarthen,
 the siege was raised,[118] and Rees accompanied John back to England
 for a meeting with Richard at Oxford; Richard, however, declined the
 interview.[119] His refusal may have been due to some suspicion of
 a private agreement between Rees and John which is asserted in the
 Welsh annals;[120] but his suspicions, if he had any, did not prevent
 him from continuing, almost to the eve of his own departure from
 England, to develope an elaborate scheme of provision for John. The
 very first step in this scheme had already led to trouble, though the
 trouble was easily overcome. John and Isabel had been married without a
 dispensation and in defiance of Archbishop Baldwin of Canterbury, who
 had forbidden, as contrary to canon law, a union between cousins under
 such circumstances. After the marriage had taken place he declared it
 invalid, and laid an interdict upon the lands of the guilty couple.
 John, however, appealed to Rome, and got the better of the primate; in
 November the interdict was raised by a papal legate.[121]

 The Pipe Roll drawn up a month after John’s marriage shows him as
 holding, besides his wife’s honour of Gloucester, the honours of
 Peverel, Lancaster and Tickhill, two manors in Suffolk, three in
 Worcestershire, and some lands in Northamptonshire, together with the
 profits of the Forest of Sherwood in Nottinghamshire and of that of
 Andover in Wiltshire. All these grants were construed as liberally
 as possible in John’s favour; he was allowed the profits of the two
 forests for a whole year past, and the revenues of the other lands
 for a quarter of a year, while the third penny of Gloucestershire
 was reckoned as due to him for half a year--that is, from a date
 five months before his investiture with the earldom.[122] The grants
 of Peverel’s honour and Lancaster included the castles[123]; in the
 cases of Tickhill and Gloucester the castles were reserved by the
 king, and so too, apparently, was a castle on one of John’s Suffolk
 manors, Orford.[124] Four other honours appear to have been given
 to John at this time--Marlborough and Luggershall, including their
 castles; Eye and Wallingford, seemingly without their castles.[125]
 The aggregate value of all these lands would be about £1170; but a
 much greater gift soon followed. Before the end of the year six whole
 counties--Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Dorset, Somerset, Devon and
 Cornwall--were added to the portion of the count of Mortain. The words
 in which this grant is recorded by the chroniclers convey a very
 inadequate idea of its real importance; taken by themselves, they
 might be understood to mean merely that Richard gave his brother the
 title and the third penny of the revenue from each of the counties
 named.[126] That what he actually did give was something very different
 we learn from the Pipe Rolls, or rather from the significant omission
 which is conspicuous in them for the next five years. From Michaelmas
 1189 to Michaelmas 1194 these six counties made no appearance at all
 in the royal accounts. They sent no returns of any kind to the royal
 treasury; they were visited by no justices appointed by the king. In a
 word, just as Chester and Durham were palatinates in the hands of earl
 and bishop respectively, so John’s two counties in mid-England and four
 in the south-west formed a great palatinate in his hands. He received
 and retained their ferms and the profits of justice and administration
 within their borders, and ruled them absolutely at his own will, the
 Crown claiming from him no account for them whatever.
 
 The total revenue which the Crown had derived from these six counties
 in the year immediately preceding their transfer to John was a little
 over £4000.[127] But their money value was a consideration of trifling
 importance compared with the territorial and political power which
 accompanied it. Such an accumulation of palatine jurisdictions in the
 hands of one man was practically equivalent to the setting up of an
 under-kingdom, with a king uncrowned indeed, but absolutely independent
 of every secular authority except the supreme king himself; and that
 exception, as every one knew, was only for the moment; Richard was
 on the eve of his departure for the Holy Land, and as soon as he was
 out of reach John would have, within his little realm, practically no
 superior at all. Moreover, his “lordship of Ireland” had changed its
 character at his father’s death. Until then it had been, save during
 his five months’ visit to that country in 1185, merely titular. Most
 of the few known charters and grants issued in his name during his
 father’s lifetime are dateless, and it seems possible that, with one
 exception, all of them may have been issued during that visit.[128] On
 Henry’s death, however, John’s lordship of the English March in Ireland
 became something more than a name. In virtue of it he already possessed
 a staff of household officers whose titles and functions reproduced
 those of the royal household itself. Henry had had his seneschal, his
 butler, his constable for Ireland as well as for England; and this
 Irish household establishment had apparently been transferred to John,
 at any rate since 1185. No doubt the men of whom it consisted were
 appointed by Henry, or at least with his sanction, and were in fact his
 ministers rather than the ministers of his son; but to the new king
 they owed no obedience save the general obedience due from all English
 or Norman subjects; from the hour of Henry’s death their service
 belonged to the “Lord of Ireland” alone, and John thus found himself at
 the head of a little court of his own, a ready-made ministry through
 which he might govern both his Irish dominion and the ample possessions
 which Richard bestowed upon him in England, as freely as the rest of
 the English realm was governed by Richard himself through the ministers
 of the Crown.[129]
 
 Of the way in which John was likely to use his new independence he
 had already given a significant indication. Shortly after Richard’s
 accession the wardship of the heiress of Leinster, Isabel de Clare, was
 terminated by her marriage with William the Marshal.[130] Her great
 Irish fief, as well as her English and Welsh lands, thus passed into
 the hands of a man who was already one of the most trusted friends and
 counsellors of Richard, as he had been of Henry, and whose brother
 had once been seneschal to John himself.[131] No sooner had William
 entered upon the heritage of his wife than John disseised him of a
 portion of Leinster and parcelled it out among friends of his own.
 The Marshal appealed to Richard; Richard insisted upon John’s making
 restitution, and John, after some demur, was compelled to yield, but
 not entirely; he managed to secure the ratification of a grant which he
 had made to his butler, Theobald Walter, out of the Marshal’s lands,
 although, by way of compromise, it was settled that Theobald should
 hold the estate in question as an under-tenant of William, not as a
 tenant-in-chief of John.[132] On the other hand, John did not at once
 displace the governor whom his father had set over the Irish march
 four years before, John de Courcy. He had no thought of undertaking
 the personal government of his dominions in Ireland. To do so he must
 have turned his back upon the opportunities which Richard’s misplaced
 generosity was opening to him in England--opportunities of which it
 was not difficult to foresee the effect upon such a mind as his. As
 William of Newburgh says, “The enjoyment of a tetrarchy made him covet
 a monarchy.”[133]
 
 [Sidenote: 1190]
 
 That Richard presently awoke to some consciousness of the danger which
 he had created for himself and his realm maybe inferred from the fact
 that in February 1190 he summoned John to Normandy, and there made
 him swear not to set foot in England for the next three years. The
 queen-mother, however, afterwards persuaded her elder son to release
 the younger one from this oath;[134] or, according to another account,
 to leave the decision of the matter to the justiciar and chancellor,
 William of Longchamp, bishop of Ely. John was to visit the chancellor
 in England, and either remain there or go into exile, as William might
 choose.[135] It is clear, however, that William had no real choice. He
 was legate in England, and therefore absolution from him was necessary
 to protect John against the ecclesiastical consequences of a violated
 oath; but as the violation was sanctioned by the king to whom the
 oath had been sworn, no ground was left to William for refusing the
 absolution.
 
 [Sidenote: 1191]
 
 In the course of the year 1190, therefore, or very early in 1191, John
 returned to England.[136] In February 1191 the sole remaining check
 upon both John and William of Longchamp was removed: Queen Eleanor went
 to join her elder son at Messina.[137] As soon as she was gone, the
 results of the concession which he had made to her wishes in John’s
 behalf began to show themselves. On Mid-Lent Sunday, March 24, the
 count of Mortain and the chancellor had an interview at Winchester
 “concerning the keepers of certain castles, and the money granted
 to the count by his brother out of the exchequer.”[138] What passed
 between them we are not told; but it is clear that they disagreed.
 Three months elapsed without any overt act of aggression on either
 side. Then, all at once, about midsummer, it became apparent that a
 party which for more than a year had been seeking an opportunity to
 undermine the chancellor’s power had found a rallying-point and a
 leader in the king’s brother. The sheriff of Lincolnshire and constable
 of Lincoln Castle, Gerard de Camville, being summoned to answer before
 the justiciars for having made his great fortress into a hold of
 robbers and bandits, defied their authority on the plea that he had
 become John’s liegeman, and was therefore answerable to no one except
 John.[139] The chancellor deprived Gerard of his sheriffdom and gave
 it to another man, and laid siege to Lincoln Castle.[140] While he was
 thus occupied, the castles of Nottingham and Tickhill were given up by
 their custodians to John.[141] Thereupon John sent to the chancellor
 a message of insolent defiance. If William did not at once withdraw
 from Lincoln and leave Gerard in unmolested possession, the count of
 Mortain threatened to “come and visit him with a rod of iron, and with
 such a host as he would not be able to withstand.”[142] With a cutting
 allusion at once to the chancellor’s humble origin and to the readiness
 with which the commandants of Nottingham and Tickhill had betrayed the
 fortresses committed to their charge, he added that “no good came of
 depriving lawful freeborn Englishmen of the offices of trust to which
 they were entitled, and giving them to unknown strangers; the folly
 of such a proceeding had just been proved in the case of the royal
 castles which William had entrusted to men who left them exposed to
 every passer-by; any chance comer would have found their gates open
 to him as easily as they had opened to John himself. Such a state of
 affairs in his brother’s realm he was resolved to tolerate no longer.”
 The chancellor’s retort was a peremptory summons to John to give up
 the two castles, and “answer before the king’s court for the breach
 of his oath.”[143] William probably hoped to get John expelled from
 England, on the plea that Richard had never really consented to his
 return and that his absolution was therefore invalid, as having been
 extorted on a false pretence. The summons appears to have been carried
 by Archbishop Walter of Rouen, who had come from Messina charged
 with a special commission from Richard to deal with the crisis in
 England.[144] John, on receiving the chancellor’s message, burst into
 one of the paroxysms of fury characteristic of his race. “He was more
 than angry,” says a contemporary; “his whole body was so contorted with
 rage as to be scarcely recognizable; a scowl of wrath furrowed his
 brow; his eyes flashed fire, his colour changed to a livid white, and I
 know what would have become of the chancellor if in that hour of fury
 he had come within reach of John’s hands!” In the end, however, the
 archbishop persuaded both John and William to hold another conference
 at Winchester on July 28.[145]
 
 John secured the services of four thousand armed Welshmen, whom he
 apparently brought up secretly, in small parties, from the border, and
 hid in various places round about the city. No disturbance, however,
 took place; some of the bishops, under the direction of Walter of
 Rouen, drew up a scheme of agreement which, for the moment, both John
 and William found it advisable to accept. The castles of Nottingham
 and Tickhill were surrendered by John to the king {1191 July 28} in
 the person of his special representative the archbishop of Rouen, who
 was to give them in charge, one to William of Venneval--a liegeman of
 the king, but a friend and follower of John--the other to William the
 Marshal; these two custodians were to hold them for the king till his
 return, and then “act according to his will concerning them”; but if he
 should die, or if meanwhile the chancellor should break the peace with
 John, they were to restore them to John. New custodians were appointed,
 on the like terms, to six royal castles which stood within John’s
 territories,[146] and also to two castles which Richard had expressly
 granted to him,--Bolsover and the Peak. Any new castles built since the
 king’s departure were to be razed, and no more were to be built till
 his return, save, if necessary, on the royal demesnes, or elsewhere
 in pursuance of special orders, written or verbal, from himself. No
 man was to be disseised either by the king’s ministers or by the count
 of Mortain, save in execution of a legal sentence delivered after
 trial before the king’s court; and each party was pledged to amend, on
 complaint from the other, its own infringements of this rule, which
 was at once applied to the case of Gerard de Camville. Gerard, having
 been disseised without trial, was reinstated in his sheriffdom; but
 his reinstatement was ordered to be immediately followed by a trial
 before the Curia Regis on the charges brought against him, and the
 decision of the Curia was to be final; if it went against him, John
 was not to support him in resistance to it; and John was further bound
 not to harbour any known outlaws or enemies of the king, nor any
 person accused of treason, except on condition of such person pledging
 himself to stand his trial in the king’s court. The archbishop of Rouen
 received a promise from John and from the chancellor, each supported by
 seven sureties, that they would keep this agreement. After it was drawn
 up, a postscript appears to have been added: “If any thing should be
 taken or intercepted by either party during the truce, it shall be
 lawfully restored and amends made for it. And these things are done,
 saving always the authority and commands of our lord the king; yet so
 that if the king before his return should not will this agreement to be
 kept, the aforesaid castles of Nottingham and Tickhill shall be given
 up to Lord John, whatever the king may order concerning them.” The last
 clause is obscure; but its meaning seems to be that if the arrangement
 just made should prove to be, in the judgment of the king’s ministers,
 untenable, it was to be treated as void, and matters were to be
 restored to the position in which they had been before it was made.[147]
 
 The contingency which seems to have been contemplated in this
 postscript very soon occurred. Some mercenaries whom the chancellor had
 summoned from over sea landed in England, and he at once repudiated
 the agreement, declaring there should be no peace till either he or
 John was driven out of the realm.[148] Hereupon it seems that Venneval
 and the Marshal, in accordance with the clause above quoted, restored
 the castles of Tickhill and Nottingham to John. On the other hand, an
 outrage on John’s part, which is recorded only as having occurred some
 time in this year (1191), certainly took place before October, and most
 likely before the middle of September. Roger de Lacy, the constable
 of Chester, who was responsible to Longchamp for the safe keeping of
 these two castles, made a vigorous effort to bring to justice the
 subordinate castellans to whom he had entrusted them, and who had
 betrayed them to John. Of these there had been two in each castle.
 Two managed to keep out of Lacy’s reach; the other two he caught and
 hanged, although one of them offered to swear with compurgators that he
 had never consented to the treason of his colleague, and even brought a
 letter from John requesting that the compurgation might be allowed--the
 chancellor, to whom the question had been referred, having remitted it
 to the decision of Lacy. While this man’s body was hanging in chains,
 his squire drove the birds away from it; whereupon Roger de Lacy hanged
 the squire. Then John took upon himself to avenge them both, not only
 by disseising Roger of all the lands which he held of him, but also by
 ravaging the lands which Roger possessed elsewhere.[149]
 
 Some time in August or September another assembly was called to
 endeavour after a pacification between John and the chancellor. Three
 bishops and twenty-two laymen were appointed arbitrators--the laymen
 chosen by the bishops, eleven from the party which had hitherto
 adhered to William, eleven from the followers of John. The terms which
 these twenty-five laid down amounted to a decision wholly in John’s
 favour. They did, indeed, again require him to restore the two royal
 castles of Nottingham and Tickhill; but they made the restoration an
 empty form. They decreed that the chancellor should put these castles
 under the control of two men whom they named, William of Venneval
 and another friend of John’s, Reginald de Vasseville. These two were
 to hold the castles for the king and give William hostages for their
 fidelity; but if Richard should die before reaching home, they were
 at once to surrender the castles to John, and William was to restore
 their hostages. The arbitrators further confirmed Gerard de Camville
 in the constableship of Lincoln castle; they ordered the chancellor
 to remove the constables of royal castles situated within the lands
 of the count of Mortain, and appoint others in their stead, “if the
 count showed reason for changing them”; and they added that “if the
 king should die, the chancellor was not to disinherit the count, but
 to do his utmost to promote him to the kingdom.”[150] This last clause
 was pointed at a negotiation which William had been carrying on with
 the Scot king, for the purpose of obtaining his recognition of Arthur
 of Britanny as heir-presumptive to the English Crown. The negotiation
 was secret; but John had discovered it,[151] and the discovery was
 a useful weapon in his hands. William’s dealings with Scotland were
 most probably sanctioned by Richard; their object was certainly in
 accord with Richard’s own plans for the succession at this time; but
 Richard’s choice of Arthur as his heir was probably unknown as yet to
 the majority of his subjects, and if it was known to them, it could not
 commend itself to their ideas either of policy or of constitutional
 practice. In their eyes the king’s next-of-kin and natural successor
 was not his boy-nephew, but his brother. It was therefore easy for John
 to win their sympathies by representing the scheme as part of a plot
 contrived against himself by the chancellor.
 
 The new agreement lasted no longer than its predecessor. Scarcely was
 it drawn up when there occurred an excellent opportunity for John
 to secure for himself a new and valuable ally in the person of his
 half-brother Geoffrey, the eldest son of Henry II. and the predecessor
 of Longchamp in the office of chancellor of England. Geoffrey, like
 John, had in the spring of 1190 been sworn to keep out of England for
 three years; but, like John too, he had obtained from Richard a release
 from his oath.[152] His election to the see of York had been confirmed
 by the Pope on May 11, 1191,[153] and it was known that he intended
 to return to England immediately after his consecration.[154] Richard
 had given him a written release from his vow of absence,[155] but had
 neglected to apprise the chancellor of the fact; William therefore
 no sooner heard of Geoffrey’s purpose to return than he issued, on
 July 30, a writ ordering that the archbishop should be arrested on
 landing.[156] Geoffrey had written to John, begging for his help; John
 in reply promised to stand by him.[157] On August 18 Geoffrey was
 consecrated at Tours,[158] and John then urged him to come over at
 once.[159] On September 14 Geoffrey reached Dover; he escaped from an
 attempt to arrest him as he landed, but four days later he was forcibly
 dragged from sanctuary in S. Martin’s priory and flung into prison in
 the castle.[160]
 
 John immediately wrote to the chancellor, demanding whether these
 things had been done by his authority. According to one account,
 William answered that they had.[161] A letter from William himself to
 the chapter of Canterbury, however, declares that he had merely ordered
 his officers to administer to Geoffrey the oath of fealty to the king
 (which it was usual for a bishop to take before entering upon his
 see), and if he refused it, to send him back to the Continent.[162]
 However this might be, it is clear that, outwardly at least, the
 chancellor had put himself in the wrong. He was already the most
 unpopular man in England; now, all parties in Church and State joined
 hands against him at once; and it was inevitable that they should
 rally under the command of John. John sent another letter or message
 to William, bidding him release the archbishop, and swearing that if
 this were not done immediately, he, the count of Mortain, would go in
 person “with a mighty hand and a stretched-out arm” to set his brother
 at liberty.[163] On September 21 or 26 Geoffrey was released.[164]
 Meanwhile John, with his confidant Hugh of Nonant, the bishop of
 Coventry, hurried down from Lancaster to Marlborough and invited all
 whom he thought likely to take his side to join him there. Three of the
 co-justiciars--William the Marshal among them--answered his call; three
 bishops, one of whom was the venerated Hugh of Lincoln, did likewise;
 and so did Archbishop Walter of Rouen. From Marlborough the party
 moved on to Reading; thence John despatched a personal invitation, or
 summons, to Geoffrey,[165] and at the same time issued, in conjunction
 with the three justiciars, letters calling the rest of the bishops and
 barons to a council to be holden on October 5 at the bridge over the
 Lodden between Reading and Windsor, and a summons to the chancellor
 to appear there and answer for his conduct.[166] William retorted by
 issuing counter writs, summoning all those who had joined the count
 of Mortain to withdraw from him, “forasmuch as he was endeavouring to
 usurp the kingdom to himself.”[167]
 
 John and all his party came to the Lodden bridge on the day which they
 had appointed; the chancellor, who was at Windsor, sent the bishop of
 London and three earls to excuse his absence on the plea of illness.
 The outcome of the day’s discussion was that the assembly, by the voice
 of Walter of Rouen, pledged itself to depose William from the office of
 chief justiciar.
