“Yes, Emily."

“Will you remember what we were saying the

“I will endeavour to do my duty as best I may,"

said Sir Harry, after a pause.

“I am sure you will, Papa;—and so do I. I do

endeavour to do my duty. Will you not try to help

him ?"

“Certainly, I will try to help him; for your sake

rather than for his own. If I can help him with

money, by paying his debts and giving him means to

live, I will do so.”

“Papa, that is not what I mean.”

“What else can I do?”.

“Save him from the evil of his ways."

“I will try. I would, --if I knew how, even if

“For my sake also, Papa. Papa, let us do it to-

it was a dull, dreary day in November, and he took

he close carriage. The distance was about ten miles,

ind he had therefore something above an hour for

hinking. When 'men think much, they can rarely

decide. The affairs as to which a man has once

ucknowledged to himself that he may be either wise

or foolish, prudent or imprudent, are seldom matters

on which he can by any amount of thought bring

Eimself to a purpose which to his own eyes shall be

clearly correct. When he can decide without thinking,

then he can decide without a doubt, and with perfect

satisfaction. But in this matter Sir Harry thought

much. There had been various times at which he was

quite sure that it was his duty to repudiate this cousin

utterly. There had never been a time at which he

had been willing to accept him. Nevertheless, at this

moment, with all his struggles of thought he could

not resolve. Was his higher duty due to his daughter,

of his daughter should at any rate be a gentleman.

Sir Harry to himself. And Emily would consent that

gold there, it might be possibleto send the dross

adrift, and to get the gold without alloy. Could Lady

Altringham have read Sir Harry's mind as his carriage

was pulled up, just at twelve o'clock, at the door of

che Penrith Crown, she would have been stronger than

ever in her belief that young lovers, if they be firm,

can always conquer opposing parents.

But alas, alas, there was no gold with this dross,

and in that matter of blood, as to which Sir Harry's

ideas were so strong, and indeed so noble, he enter-

But that rule holds as good with a Buonaparte as

with a Bourbon, with a Cromwell as with a Stewart

· When Sir Harry got out of his carriage, he h

not yet made up his mind. The waiter had be

told that he was expected, and showed him up

once into the large sitting-room looking out into t

street, which Cousin George had bespoke fort

occasion. He had had a smaller room himself, z

had been smoking there, and at this moment in th

room there was a decanter and a wine-glass on t

chiffonier in one corner. He had heard the bustle

prepared for the reception of the great man. “Ia

so sorry to give you this trouble,” said Cousin Georg

Sir Harry could not refuse his cousin's hand, thou

had prepared his speech beforehand.

“And what have you to recommend you to a father

for such permission? Do you not know, sir, that when

a gentleman proposes to a lady it is his duty to show

that he is in a condition fit for the position which he

seeks; that in character, in means, in rank, in conduct,

he is at least her equal."

“As for our rank, Sir Harry, it is the same.”

"And for your means? You know that my daughter

is my heiress?”

“I do; but it is not that that has brought me to

her. Of course, I have nothing. But then, you know,

though she will inherit the estates, I must inherit "

“If you please, sir, we will not go into all that

again,” said Sir Harry, interrupting him. “I explained

to you before, sir, that I would have admitted your

future rank as a counterpoise to her fortune, if I could

have trusted your character. I cannot trust it. I do

not know why you should thrust upon me the necessity

of saying all this again. As I believe that you are in

pecuniary distress, I made you an offer which I thought

to be liberal."

“It was liberal, but it did not suit me to accept

it.” George had an inkling of what would pass within

Sir Harry's bosom as to the acceptance or rejection of

that offer. “I wrote to you, declining it, and as I

Now Sir Harry had doubted much in his o

mind as to the letter. During that morning's int

view it had still been in his own possession. As

was preparing to leave the house he had made up

mind that she should have it; and Lady Elizabe

had been commissioned to give it her, not with

"I cannot do that, Sir Harry."

she had made him so solemnly: “Papa, there never

was infinitely more of trouble and shame in this world

had done; and a disgrace also that his daughter should

“Will you give up London?”

“London!” In simple truth, George did not quite

understand the proposition.

“Yes; will you leave London? Will you go and

- life at Scarrowby, and learn to look after the farm

and the place?”

George's face fell,—his face being less used to

lying than his tongue; but his tongue lied at once:

“Oh yes, certainly, if you wish it. I should rather

like a life of that sort. For how long would it be?”.

“For two years,” said Sir Harry, grimly.

Cousin George, in truth, did not understand. He

thought that he was to take his bride with him when

he went to Scarrowby. “Perhaps Emily would not

like it,” he said.

“It is what she desires. You do not suppose that

she knows so little of your past life as to be willing to

trust herself into your hands at once. She is attached

to you."

“And so am I to her; on my honour I am. I'm

sure you don't doubt that."

Sir Harry doubted every word that fell from his

cousin's mouth, but still he persevered. He could

perceive though he could not analyse, and there was

hardly a tone which poor Cousin George used which

was very near.

“You are fond of shooting, and you will have

plenty of it there. We will get you made a magistrate

for the county, and there is much to do in looking

after the property.” Sir Harry became almost good-

humoured in his tone as he described the kind of life

which he intended that the blackamoor should live.

“We will come to you for a month each year, and

then you can come to us for a while.”

“When shall it begin?” asked Cousin George, as

soon as the Baronet paused. This was a question

difficult to be answered. In fact, the arrangement

must be commenced at once. Sir Harry knew very

well that, having so far yielded, he must take his

cousin back with him to Humblethwaite. He must

keep his cousin now in his possession till all those

debts should be paid, and till the house at Scarrowby

should be prepared; and he must trust to his daughter's

CHAPTER XXI.

Emily Hotspur's Sermon.

THE greater portion of the journey back to Humble-

hwaite was passed in silence. Sir Harry had under-

aken an experiment in which he had no faith himself,

and was sad at heart. Cousin George was cowed,

nalf afraid, and yet half triumphant. Could it be pos-

sible that he should "pull through” after all? Some

hings had gone so well with him. His lady friends

nad been so true to him! Lady Altringham, and then

Mrs. Morton,-how good they had been! Dear Lucy!

le would never forget her. And Emily was such a -

orick! He was going to see his Emily, and that

vould be “so jolly.” Nevertheless, he did acknow-

edge to himself that an Emily prepared to assist her

eather in sending her lover through the fire of reform,

“It is right that I should tell you so; but I tru

Then he pressed his cousin's hand, if not wit

affection, at least with sincerity.

“I'm sure it is to be all right now," said George

calculating whether he would be able to escape t

London for a few days, so that he might be able t

arrange that little matter with Mr. Hart. They couldn

suppose that he would be able to leave London fo

two years without a day's notice!

Sir Harry got out of the carriage at the front door

and desired Cousin George to follow him into th

house. He turned at once into the small room wher

George had drunk the sherry, and desired that Lady

Elizabeth might be sent to him.

she sees her cousin.” This was all said in George's

hearing. And then Sir Harry went, leaving his cousin

in the hands of Lady Elizabeth.

“I am glad to see you back again, George," she

said, with a melancholy voice.

Cousin George smiled, and said, that "it would

be all right.”

"I am sure I hope so, for my girl's sake. But

there must be a great change, George.”

“No end of a change,” said Cousin George, who

was not in the least afraid of Lady Elizabeth. .

Many things of moment had to be done in the

house that day before dinner. In the first place there

was a long interview between the father and daughter.

For a few minutes, perhaps, he was really happy

when she was kneeling with her arms upon his knees,

thanking him for what he had done, while tears of

joy were streaming down her cheeks. He would not

bring himself to say a word of caution to her. Would

it not be to paint the snow white to caution her as to

her conduct?

“I have done as you bade me in everything," he

said. “I have proposed to him that he should go to

Before dinner Sir Harry wrote a letter to his

lawyer. The mail-cart passed through the village on

its way to Penrith late in the evening, and there was

time for him to save the post. He thought it in-

cumbent on him to let Mr. Boltby know that he had

changed his mind; and, though the writing of the

letter was not an agreeable task, he did it at once.

He said nothing to Mr. Boltby directly about his

daughter, but he made it known to that gentleman

that Cousin George was at present a guest at Humble-

thwaite, and that he intended to pay all the debts

without entering into any other specific engagements.

Would Mr. Boltby have the goodness to make out a

schedule of the debts? Captain Hotspur should be

instructed to give Mr. Boltby at once all the neces-

sary information by letter. Then Sir Harry went on

to say that perhaps the opinions formed in reference

to Captain Hotspur had been too severe. He was

ashamed of himself as he wrote these words, but still

they were written. If the blackamoor was to be

washed white, the washing must be carried out at all

times, at all seasons, and in every possible manner,

till the world should begin to see that the blackness

was going out of the skin.

Harry told his cousin of the letter to his lawyer, and

desired George to make out and send by that day's

post such a schedule as might be possible on the spur

of the moment.

“Hadn't I better run up and see Mr. Boltby?”

said Cousin George.

But to this Sir Harry was opposed. Let any calls

for money reach them there. Whatever the calls might

be, he at any rate could pay them. Cousin George

repeated his suggestion; but acquiesced when Sir Harry

frowned and showed his displeasure. He did make

out a schedule, and did write a letter to Mr. Boltby.

“I think my debt to Mr. Hart was put down as

3,250l.,” he wrote, “but I believe I should have added

another 350l. for a transaction as to which I fancy he

. He was fool enough to think that Mr. Walker's

claim might be liquidated after this fashion. In the

afternoon they rode together,—the father, the daughter,

and the blackamoor, and much was told to Cousin

George as to the nature of the property. The names

of the tenants were mentioned, and the boundaries of

the farms were pointed out to him. He was thinking

all the time whether Mr. Hart would spare him.

“It is so nice to have you here, George,” she said.

“Yes, indeed; isn't it?” He was walking beside

“I do not care how often you tell me.”

Walker and Bullbean, in the lodgings of the former,

at about nine in the evening, and remained there dur-

he had managed to daub over and partly to hide his

own settled convictions as to his cousin's character fell

away, and he saw the man as he had seen him during

his interview with Captain Stubber and Mr. Hart. It

the telling, it would be better than that she should be

handed over to such a man as this. The misfortune

which had come upon them might be the death of him

and of her;- but better that than the other. He sat

in his chair till the gong sounded through the house

for prayers; then he rang his bell and sent in word to

Lady Elizabeth that she should read them in his

absence. When they were over, word was brought

that he would breakfast alone, in his own room.
