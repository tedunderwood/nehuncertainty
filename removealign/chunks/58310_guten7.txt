 It seems probable that at the close of Richard’s
 reign his ministers may have thus seized the castles or lands of
 certain barons in pledge for the arrears of their dues to the crown,
 and that this may have been one of the grievances referred to in the
 demand of the barons that Richard’s successor “should restore to each
 of them his rights.” John’s demand for the castles of some of the
 barons in 1201 was in all likelihood a proceeding of the same kind,
 based on the same ground, and, as it seems, equally ineffectual in
 compelling payment; all that the king obtained was the surrender not
 indeed of the castles, but of some of the barons’ sons as hostages. The
 deadlock was probably inevitable; but every year of its continuance
 aggravated both the financial difficulties of the government, and the
 unfriendliness of the relations between the barons and the king; and
 this latter evil was yet further aggravated by the measures which had
 necessarily to be taken in order to meet the former one. Plunged as he
 was from the very moment of his accession in a costly struggle with
 France, John had been forced to lay continually fresh burdens upon
 that very class among his subjects who already were, or considered
 themselves to be, overburdened by the demands of his predecessor. The
 “first scutage of King John” seems to have been assessed immediately
 after his coronation; it appears in the Pipe Roll made up at Michaelmas
 1199. In the financial year ending at Michaelmas 1201, and in every one
 of the five following years, there was another new scutage;[518] and
 these scutages were independent of the fines paid by the barons who
 did not accompany the king on his first return to Normandy in 1199, of
 the money taken from the host as a substitute for its service in 1201,
 of the equipment and payment of the “decimated” knights in 1205, and
 the fines claimed from all the tenants-in-chivalry after the dismissal
 of the host in the same year, as well as of the actual services which
 many of those who had paid the scutage rendered in the campaigns of
 1202–1204 and 1206.
 
 The other taxes levied during these years were a carucage in
 1200[519]and a seventh of moveables in 1204.[520] But all the while
 arrears went on accumulating, and year after year a budget had to be
 made up by devices of the most miscellaneous character. The accession
 of a new king could, of course, easily be made a pretext for selling
 confirmations of existing rights and privileges, and John availed
 himself of this pretext to the uttermost of his power at the earliest
 opportunity--that is, on his visit to England in 1201. During that
 time nobody in England seems to have felt secure of anything that he
 possessed till he had bought it of the king. Individuals of various
 ranks bought the sovereign’s “peace” or his “goodwill”;[521] the cities
 of Winchester and Southampton and the county of Hants each gave him
 money “that they might be lovingly treated”;[522] Wiltshire gave him
 twenty pounds “that it might be well treated.”[523] The citizens of
 York offended him by omitting to welcome him with a procession when
 he visited their city, and to provide quarters for his cross-bowmen;
 he demanded hostages for their future good behaviour, but afterwards
 changed his demand to a fine of a hundred pounds.[524] The sale of
 offices went on as of old;[525] while the sale of charters to towns,
 which under Richard was already becoming a remarkable item in the royal
 accounts, was a transaction of yet greater frequency and importance
 under his successor.[526] On the other hand, John’s treasury rolls
 contain many notices of persons who owe the king money “which he has
 lent them.” These loans from the king to his barons and other subjects
 were probably made chiefly in the hope of securing the fidelity of the
 borrowers. In one way or another the speculation must have been in most
 cases a paying one for John. The privilege of claiming interest in
 hard cash for a loan was indeed reserved exclusively for the Jews, and
 not shared even by the king; but he could take from his debtors ample
 security on their lands or castles, or by means of hostages who were
 usually their sons or other young members of their families, and whom
 it was of the greater importance for him to hold in his power as his
 relations with the barons grew more strained year by year.
 
 [Sidenote: 1207]
 
 In 1206 the tension had reached such a point that John did not venture
 to impose a scutage of the full amount--two marks on the knight’s
 fee--which had been usual since his father’s time, but contented himself
 with twenty shillings.[527] In 1207 he evidently dared not attempt
 to levy any fresh scutage at all. Nor was a carucage likely to prove
 either less unpopular or more productive; for the agricultural interest
 of the country was in a state of extreme depression, owing to a long
 succession of bad seasons; while the taxation of moveables was an
 expedient which seems to have found, as yet, but little favour with
 either the people or the government. John now put forth a suggestion
 which was, so far as we can see, a novelty in English finance. He “held
 a council in London on January 8, and there requested the bishops and
 abbots that they would allow parsons and others holding ecclesiastical
 benefices to give to the king a fixed sum from their revenues.”[528]
 Neither in equity nor in policy was the idea a bad one. While the
 military tenants and the socage tenants had each their own peculiar
 burden--scutage in the one case, carucage in the other--the beneficed
 clergy, as such, had never yet been subjected to taxation. The king
 might well argue that it was time for them to take their turn in
 making a special contribution to the financial needs of the State;
 and the argument was sure to meet with the approval of the laity. The
 prelates, however, were unwilling; and the question was adjourned to
 another council, in which “an infinite multitude” of ecclesiastical and
 temporal magnates came together at Oxford on February 9.
 
 At this second meeting the bishops of both provinces gave it as their
 final answer that “the English Church could by no means submit to a
 demand which had never been heard of in all previous ages.”[529] The
 only approach to a precedent for it, indeed, had occurred in 1194,
 when Archbishop Geoffrey of York, eager to collect money for Richard’s
 ransom, had asked the canons of his cathedral chapter to give for that
 purpose a fourth part of their revenues for the year, with the result
 that they accused him of “wanting to overthrow the liberties of their
 church,” and shut its doors in his face.[530] Between the council in
 London and that at Oxford, Geoffrey and John, who had been more or
 less at variance ever since the latter’s accession, were formally
 reconciled;[531] John therefore probably counted upon Geoffrey’s
 support of his scheme, and he may have hoped that the suffragans of
 Canterbury, having no metropolitan of their own to lead them, would
 not venture to stand out against the northern primate and the king
 with the barons, for once, at his back. But what Geoffrey had himself
 asked of his own chapter as a special favour to Richard in a wholly
 exceptional emergency, he had no mind to give leave for John to claim
 from all the beneficed clergy of his province as a matter of right, and
 under entirely different circumstances. The king was prudent enough
 not to press his demand; but it may be doubted whether the lay barons
 agreed with the Waverley annalist in deeming its withdrawal a proof
 that he “had taken wiser counsel,” since he substituted for it a demand
 for a thirteenth of the moveable goods of every layman throughout the
 realm.[532] This they had no excuse for refusing. “All murmured,
 but no man dared contradict,”[533] except Geoffrey of York. He, it
 seems, claimed exemption for laymen holding lands of the Church, or at
 least of his cathedral church. His protest, however, was disregarded;
 whereupon he excommunicated all spoilers of the Church in general, and
 of the province of York in particular, and then withdrew over sea,[534]
 to spend the rest of his life in exile.
 
 [Sidenote: 1208]
 
 Thus for the next eight years the vast diocese of York was practically
 without a chief pastor and the province without a metropolitan,
 while the temporalities of the see were in the hand of the king. As
 for Canterbury, John had answered the Pope’s request that he would
 ratify the election of Stephen Langton by a flat refusal to accept as
 primate a man of whom he declared that he “knew nothing, save that he
 had dwelt much among his enemies”;[535] and when on June 17 Stephen
 was consecrated by Innocent,[536] the king seized the estates of the
 Canterbury chapter, drove the monks into exile,[537] and proclaimed
 that any one who acknowledged Stephen as archbishop should be accounted
 a public enemy.[538] In August Innocent bade the bishops of London,
 Ely and Worcester threaten the king, if he continued obstinate, with
 an interdict upon his realm, and hinted that this might be followed
 by a papal excommunication of John himself.[539] Negotiations went on
 throughout the winter, but without result,[540] and on Passion Sunday,
 March 23, or Monday, March 24, 1208, the interdict was proclaimed.[541]
 It seems that notice of the intended date of its publication was given
 about a week before, and that the king at first answered this notice
 by ordering all the property of the clergy, secular or monastic, to be
 confiscated on Monday, March 24; but that he immediately afterwards
 decided to anticipate, instead of returning, the blow, and caused
 the confiscation to be begun at once.[542] For him the opportunity
 was a golden one. The interdict enabled him to put the whole body of
 the clergy in a dilemma from which there was no escape. They held
 their property--thus he evidently argued--on condition of performing
 certain functions: if they ceased from those functions, their property
 was forfeit, just as that of a layman was forfeit if he withheld the
 service with which it was charged. The logical consequence in either
 case--from John’s point of view--was confiscation; difficult and
 dangerous to enforce on a wide scale against laymen, but easy and
 safe when the victims were clergy. The barons made no objection to
 a proceeding which would fill the king’s coffers without drawing a
 single penny from their own; the chief justiciar himself, Geoffrey
 Fitz-Peter, earl of Essex, had no scruple in acting as _custos_ for
 the Crown of all the Church property on his own estates, which were
 scattered through thirty-one counties, and also of the revenues and
 goods of the Templars throughout all England.[543] The spoliation was
 indeed effected with a brutal violence which would have been impossible
 had there been any strong feeling against it among the influential
 classes of the laity,[544] and which so far outran the intentions of
 the king that on April 11 he issued a proclamation ordering that any
 man caught doing or even speaking evil to a monk or a clerk, “contrary
 to our peace,” should be hanged upon the nearest oak.[545] The clergy,
 like the Jews, were to be ill-treated by no one save the king himself.
 Many of them made a compromise with their spoiler; within a very
 few weeks five bishops, three cathedral chapters, the prior of the
 Hospitallers, and the heads of fourteen important monasteries, besides
 sundry individual priests, undertook to farm their own benefices and
 other property for the king.[546] The Cistercians, asserting that
 the privileges of their order exempted them from interdict, ceased
 from performing the offices of religion for a few days only, and then
 resumed them as usual;[547] whereupon their possessions, which had been
 seized like those of the other orders, were restored to them on April
 4.[548]
 
 [Sidenote: 1209]
 
 At the same time John despatched an envoy to Rome proposing terms on
 which he professed himself willing to let Stephen take possession
 of his see; and he contrived to spin out the negotiations for six
 months before Innocent discovered that the terms offered were merely
 a device for wasting time, and that the king had never intended to
 fulfil them.[549] On January 12, 1209, the Pope informed the bishops
 of London, Ely and Worcester that he had written to John a letter of
 which he sent them a copy, and bade them excommunicate the king if
 he did not repent within three months after its receipt.[550] John
 upon this began a fresh series of negotiations, which kept the three
 bishops--who had apparently gone over sea immediately after publishing
 the interdict--flitting to and fro between the continent and England,
 without any result, for nine more months. In October they finally
 withdrew, but without publishing the excommunication; and by the end of
 the year all possibility of its publication in England had vanished,
 for every English bishop had fled save two, Peter des Roches, bishop
 of Winchester, and John de Grey, bishop of Norwich, both of whom were
 creatures of the king; John de Grey, moreover, was now justiciar
 in Ireland, and the Poitevin Peter des Roches was thus left sole
 representative of the episcopal order in England.[551]
 
 [Sidenote: 1208–09]
 
 It was John’s hour of triumph, not over the clergy alone, but over all
 his subjects and vassals within the four seas of Britain. The action
 of the Pope and the inaction of the barons had opened a way for him to
 make himself “King of England” in his own sense of the words. To all
 outward seeming his whole time, since his return from the continent,
 had been devoted to mere amusement and self-indulgence. He “haunted
 woods and streams, and greatly did he delight in the pleasure of
 them.”[552] When he was not thus chasing the beasts of the forest,
 his yet more relentless pursuit of other prey was making havoc of the
 domestic peace, and rousing against him the deadly hatred, of some of
 the greatest of his barons.[553] But their hatred was futile; they
 were paralyzed partly by their own mutual jealousies, which the king
 was continually stirring up,[554] partly by the consequence of their
 selfish shortsightedness with regard to his persecution of the clergy.
 The interdict had placed one whole estate of the realm at John’s mercy;
 and the laity, having failed at the critical moment to make common
 cause with their clerical brethren, now found themselves in their turn
 without a support against his tyranny. His consciousness of power broke
 out in the strangest freaks of wantonness; in causing the Michaelmas
 session of the Exchequer to be held at Northampton instead of London,
 “out of hatred to the Londoners”;[555] in forbidding the capture of
 birds all over England;[556] in ordering that throughout the Forest
 districts the hedges should be fired and the ditches made by the
 people to protect their fields should be levelled, “so that, while men
 starved, the beasts might fatten upon the crops and fruits.”[557] It
 showed itself too in acts of graver political significance. A series
 of orders to the bailiffs of the coast towns for the equipment and
 mustering of their ships and the seizure of foreign vessels, issued
 in the spring and summer of 1208, indicates that John was then either
 meditating another expedition over sea, or, more probably, expecting an
 attack from thence. The muster, originally fixed for Trinity Sunday,
 was postponed to S. Matthew’s day,[558] and the end of the matter was
 that John, finding he had no immediate need for the services of the
 fleet, “took occasion”--no doubt on pretext of some deficiency in the
 contingent due from them--“to oppress the mariners of the Cinque Ports
 with great and heavy affliction. Some he hanged; some he killed with
 the sword; many were imprisoned and loaded with irons”; the rest fled
 into exile, and it was only by giving him fines and hostages that they
 appeased his wrath and bought his leave to return to their homes.[559]
 The barons were again required to renew their homage; the demand was
 made literally at the sword’s point--for John’s lavish hospitality and
 largesse[560] filled his court with mercenaries who were quite ready
 to enforce his will in such a matter--and they were compelled either
 to submit to it, or to give their sons and kinsmen as hostages for
 their fidelity.[561] The king seemed indeed, as Matthew Paris says, to
 be courting the hatred of every class of his subjects.[562] But hate
 him as much as they might, they feared him yet more than they hated
 him; and “burdensome” as he was “to both rich and poor,”[563] when
 he summoned all the free tenants throughout the realm, of whatever
 condition, who were above the age of twelve years, to swear fealty in
 person to him and his infant heir in the autumn of 1209, rich and poor
 alike durst not do otherwise than obey him.[564]
 
 [Sidenote: 1209]
 
 This ceremony took place at Marlborough in September,[565] just before
 the final rupture of the negotiations with Langton and the bishops.
 A few weeks earlier John had received the submission of the king of
 Scots. Twice or thrice in the last two years a visit of William the
 Lion to the English court had been projected.[566] It took place at
 length in the middle of April 1209 at Bolton, whence John and William
 proceeded together to Norham for a conference.[567] The shelter given
 in Scotland to some of the bishops and other persons who fled from
 John’s persecution in connection with the interdict[568] supplied the
 English king with a pretext for demanding, once for all, security for
 William’s loyalty. He bade him surrender either three castles on the
 border or his only son as a hostage. William refused to do either.[569]
 John, on returning to the south, summoned his host, and in July set
 out to take the three castles by force. The papal excommunication was
 hanging over his head, and its publication was hourly expected; his
 troops shrank alike from his leadership and from an encounter with the
 Scot king, who was considered “eminent for his piety,” the champion
 of the Church and the favourite of Heaven, while they, being under
 interdict, were virtually outcasts from the Christian fold. A dexterous
 renewal of negotiations with Innocent and Stephen, however, staved
 off the excommunication and prevented the threatened desertion of the
 English troops;[570] and on August 4 John was at Norham[571] at the
 head of a great host ready to do battle with the Scots. On hearing
 this, William “greatly feared his attack, knowing him to be given to
 every kind of cruelty; so he came to meet him and offered to treat for
 peace; but the king of the English flew into a rage and insulted him
 bitterly, reproaching him with having received his (John’s) fugitives
 and public enemies into his realm, and lent them countenance and help
 against him.” At last some “friends of both realms” arranged terms
 which pacified John and which William dared not refuse. He sent his
 son {Aug. 7}, not indeed as a hostage, but to do homage to the English
 king “for the aforesaid castles and other lands which he held”;[572]
 he undertook to pay John by instalments within the next two years
 fifteen thousand marks “to have his goodwill”; he gave hostages
 for the fulfilment of this undertaking; and he surrendered his two
 daughters to be kept in John’s custody as his wards and married at his
 pleasure.[573] According to Gervase of Canterbury, one of these ladies
 was to be married to John’s son;[574] one of his many illegitimate
 sons must be meant, for though John had now two sons by his queen, the
 elder of them was not yet two years old, while the younger of William’s
 daughters was thirteen at the least.[575] All that William obtained in
 return for these concessions was the freedom of the port of Berwick,
 and leave to pull down a castle which the bishop of Durham had built
 over against it.[576] Of his claim upon Cumberland and Westmorland
 nothing further was ever heard.
 
 [Sidenote: 1199–1209]
 
 Two months later, Wales followed Scotland’s example. Over Wales,
 indeed, John’s triumph was won without the trouble even of a military
 demonstration on his part. The anarchy of Wales had been growing worse
 and worse ever since the death of Henry II. Its danger for England lay
 mainly in the opportunities which it afforded to any of the English
 barons of the border who might be treasonably inclined, for making
 alliances with one or other of the warring Welsh princes, and thus
 securing for themselves a support which might enable them to set at
 defiance the authority of the English crown. John himself had held
 the position of a border baron for ten years, as earl of Gloucester
 and lord of Glamorgan, and had used it for his own private ends as
 unscrupulously as any of his neighbours.[577] The familiarity with
 Welsh politics which he had thus acquired stood him in good stead when
 he became king. At his accession, a struggle which had been going on
 for two years between three rival claimants to the succession in South
 Wales, Griffith and Maelgwyn, sons of the late prince Rees ap Griffith,
 and Gwenwynwyn, son of Owen Cyveiliog, prince of Powys, had just ended
 in the triumph of Griffith, who, by the help of a force supplied to
 him by the English government, overcame both his rivals at the close
 of 1198. On Griffith’s death in 1200 Gwenwynwyn for a moment regained
 the ascendency in South Wales; but he found a new and formidable rival
 in the prince of North Wales, Llywelyn ap Jorwerth, who in a few years
 succeeded in reducing most of the South Welsh princes to dependence on
 himself.[578] Throughout these years John, amid all his political and
 military occupations on the continent, watched every vicissitude of the
 struggle in Wales, kept up constant relations with both parties, and
 balanced the one against the other[579] with a mingled unscrupulousness
 and dexterity for which even the Welshmen were scarcely a match, and
 which at last brought them all alike to his feet. In July 1202 Llywelyn
 promised to do homage to the English king as soon as the latter should
 return from over sea;[580] before October 15, 1204, he was betrothed
 to John’s illegitimate daughter Joan,[581] and in 1206 she became his
 wife.[582] In 1208 his rival Gwenwynwyn was in an English prison,
 whence he obtained his release by doing homage to John at Shrewsbury on
 October 8.[583] Llywelyn’s promised visit to the English court seems
 to have not yet taken place; but a year later, on the king’s return
 from the north, there befell, say the chroniclers, “what had never been
 heard of in times past: all the Welsh nobles”--that is, evidently,
 the princes of both North and South Wales--“came to him and did him
 homage,” not on the border, but in the heart of his own realm, at
 Woodstock,[584] on October 18 or 19, 1209.[585]
 
 [Sidenote: 1209–10]
 
 The king’s triumph was complete. The last date which had been fixed for
 the publication of the papal sentence was October 6;[586] the sentence
 was still unpublished, and the bishops who should have published
 it had fled. They proclaimed it indeed in France in November;[587]
 but John took care that no official notification of the fact should
 reach England, and the sentence remained a dead letter. Its existence
 was known and talked of all over the country, but it was talked of
 with bated breath. The excommunicate king held his Christmas feast
 at Windsor surrounded by “all the great men of England,” who sat at
 his table and held intercourse with him as usual, simply because
 they dared not do otherwise.[588] Of the fate in store for those who
 stood aloof, one terrible example sufficed. The archdeacon of Norwich
 quitted his place at the Exchequer table at Westminster, after warning
 his fellow-officers that they were perilling their souls by serving
 an excommunicate king. He was seized by a band of soldiers, loaded
 with chains, flung into prison, and there crushed to death beneath a
 cope of lead.[589] The whole body of the clergy, already stripped of
 their possessions, were now in peril of their lives. As the king was
 passing through one of the border counties he met some of the sheriff’s
 officers in charge of a prisoner with his hands tied behind him. They
 said the man was a robber, and had robbed and slain a priest on the
 highway: what, they asked, should be done with him? “Loose him and let
 him go” answered John, “he has slain one of my enemies!” Nor was his
 persecution limited to the clergy; the lay relatives and friends of
 Langton and of the other exiled bishops were hunted down and flung into
 prison, and their property seized for the king.[590] When he could
 plunder his Christian subjects no more, he turned upon the Jews. At the
 opening of 1210 all the Jews in England, of both sexes, were by his
 order arrested, imprisoned, and tortured to make them give up their
 wealth. It was said that the king wrung ten thousand marks from one Jew
 at Bristol by causing seven of his teeth to be torn out, one every day
 for a week,[591] and that the total sum transferred from the coffers
 of the Jews to the royal treasury amounted to sixty-six thousand
 marks.[592] Never before--not even in the worst days of William the
 Red--had England fallen so low as she now lay at the feet of John. “It
 was as if he alone were mighty upon earth, and he neither feared God
 nor regarded man.”[593] John seems in fact to have been one of the very
 few men of whom this latter assertion can be made with literal truth;
 and in this utter recklessness and ruthlessness lay the secret of his
 terrible strength. “There was not a man in the land who could resist
 his will in anything.”[594] The very few barons who had dared openly to
 resist it since his return from Poitou in 1206 were now all in Ireland;
 and it was Ireland that he set himself to subdue in 1210.
 
 [Sidenote: 1191–1200]
 
 John de Courcy had apparently ceased to be governor of the Irish
 March in 1191. The succession of governors there during the next few
 years is obscure; but we know that, as John’s chief ministers, they
 bore the same title which was borne by the chief minister of the
 king in England, that of justiciar.[595] Owing to the paucity and
 obscurity of the records it is difficult to gain any real understanding
 of the vicissitudes of the English dominion in Ireland during the
 twenty-five years which elapsed between John’s two visits to that
 country, and especially during the fourteen years between his first
 visit there and his accession to the English crown. He granted a new
 and important charter to the city of Dublin in 1192.[596] In 1195
 the intruders--neither for the first nor for the last time--fell out
 among themselves: “John de Courcy and the son of Hugh de Lacy marched
 with an army to conquer the English of Leinster and Munster.”[597]
 They certainly did not succeed in wresting Leinster from William
 the Marshal. As for Munster, Richard de Cogan was apparently still
 holding his ground in Desmond; Raymond the Fat probably died in 1184
 or 1185,[598] and as he had no direct heirs,[599] the share of that
 kingdom which had been originally allotted to Fitz-Stephen lapsed
 to John as overlord.[600] From the city of Cork the “English” are
 said to have been driven out in 1196;[601] but their expulsion was
 only momentary. Meanwhile they had at last begun to gain a footing
 in Thomond. By 1196 they had got possession of the city of Limerick;
 in that year or the next they lost it, but it was speedily recovered
 by Meiler Fitz-Henry,[602] who in 1199 or early in 1200 became chief
 justiciar in Ireland.[603] Limerick was put under the charge of William
 de Burgh, who apparently had won for himself some lands within the
 kingdom of Thomond, among them Ardpatrick, of which he received a grant
 from John in September 1199.[604]
 
 [Sidenote: 1198–1202]
 
 The last Irish Ard-Righ, Roderic O’Conor, died in 1198;[605] he had
 been dethroned sixteen years before, but his death was the signal for
 renewed strife between his sons for the possession of his kingdom of
 Connaught. The foreign settlers in Ireland took sides for their own
 interest in the struggle between the native princes; John de Courcy
 and the “English of Ulidia,” with the De Lacys of Meath and their
 followers, supported Cathal Crovderg O’Conor, while his rival, Cathal
 Carrach, was helped by “William Burke, with the English of Limerick.”
 For a moment Cathal Carrach’s party was victorious; but next year
 (1200) he was attacked by “Meiler and the English of Leinster,” while
 De Burgh changed sides and joined Cathal Crovderg. In 1201 or 1202
 the united forces of Cathal Crovderg and De Burgh won a battle in
 which Cathal Carrach was slain. Cathal Crovderg being thus master of
 Connaught, De Burgh at once began to plot against his life; but the men
 of Connaught slaughtered the followers of the double-dyed traitor, and
 he himself escaped as best he could back to Limerick.[606]
 
 [Sidenote: 1179–1201]
 
 The “honour of Limerick”--exclusive of the city and the Ostmen’s
 cantred, which the king retained in his own hands, and the service
 due from the lands held within that honour by William de Burgh, which
 was also reserved to the Crown--had meanwhile been granted by John,
 on January 12, 1201, to William de Braose, “as King Henry gave it to
 his uncle, Philip de Braose.”[607] These last words define the extent
 of the “honour,” as corresponding (with the exceptions specified) to
 the “kingdom of Limerick” (Thomond) named in Henry’s grant of 1177.
 Philip de Braose was probably now dead. William was the son of Philip’s
 elder brother, another William who to the family estates of Bramber in
 Sussex and Barnstaple and Totnes in Devon had added, by his marriage
 with an heiress, the lordships of Radnor, Brecon, and Abergavenny
 in Wales.[608] The younger William probably succeeded to all these
 possessions soon after 1179.[609] Before 1189 his sister Maud was
 married to Griffith Ap Rees, who from 1198 to 1201 was Prince of South
 Wales; and throughout the last ten years of the twelfth century William
 was constantly concerned in the quarrels of the South Welsh princes and
 people.[610] His daughter Margaret had before November 19, 1200 become
 the wife of Walter de Lacy,[611] the lord of Meath, who was already
 her father’s neighbour on the Welsh border, where Ludlow formed part
 of the Lacy heritage; a younger daughter was married before 1210 to a
 son of another baron of the Welsh March, Roger Mortimer.[612] Count
 John of Mortain, as earl of Gloucester and lord of Glamorgan, was also
 for ten years a neighbour of William de Braose, and evidently made a
 friend of him, for in 1199 William was at the head of the party which
 most vigorously urged John’s claim to the crown.[613] In June 1200 he
 received a royal grant of “all the lands which he had acquired or might
 at any future time acquire from our Welsh enemies, to the increase
 of his barony of Radnor.”[614] As the king was at the same time in
 diplomatic relations with several of the “enemies” whom William was
 thus authorized to despoil, this grant was of doubtful value. The same
 may be said of the grant of Thomond; this, however, was a speculation
 on both sides; William covenanted to pay the king five thousand marks
 for it at the rate of five hundred marks a year.[615]
 
 [Sidenote: 1201–1204]
 
 De Braose immediately went to Ireland;[616] and in process of time he
 succeeded in obtaining possession of the greater part of his new fief,
 though the difficulties with which he had to contend were many and
 great. The other persons who had previously received from John grants
 of land in Thomond[617] no doubt resented and resisted the change in
 their position from tenants-in-chief of the king to under-tenants of
 William de Braose. It seems that they were upheld in their resistance
 by the justiciar, Meiler Fitz-Henry, and that John in consequence
 summoned Meiler to his court, suspended him from his office, and put it
 into commission in December 1201. In August 1202 John issued further
 orders for enforcing the claims of De Braose in Thomond; in September
 he forgave him all the debts which he owed to King Henry and King
 Richard; in October he granted the entire custody of the lands and
 castles of Glamorgan, Gwenllwg and Gower to “William de Braose, whose
 service we greatly approve.”[618] In the winter William was with the
 king in Normandy, and had the custody of the captive Arthur. This he
 resigned, seemingly at the end of the year,[619] and in January 1203 he
 was in charge of some matters connected with the fleet.[620]
 
 [Sidenote: 1204–1206]
 
 Meanwhile the governor of Limerick city, William de Burgh, had escaped
 from the vengeance of the Irish allies whom he had betrayed, only to
 fall under that of the English justiciar whom he had set at defiance.
 Meiler Fitz-Henry had been restored to his post; in 1203 he and Walter
 de Lacy joined with the Irish of Connaught in expelling De Burgh from
 Limerick,[621] and on July 8 William de Braose was appointed by the
 king to succeed De Burgh as constable of the city.[622] Meiler and
 De Burgh had already appealed against each other to the king;[623]
 in March 1204 a commission was appointed to hear their reciprocal
 complaints;[624] in September all De Burgh’s Irish estates except those
 in Connaught were restored to him on his promise of “standing to right
 in the King’s Court of Ireland.”[625] There is no record of the trial,
 which may have been prevented by his death, for at the end of the year
 or in 1205 he died;[626] and on April 3, 1206 the justiciar was ordered
 to take all his Munster estates into the king’s hand.[627]
 
 The reservation of De Burgh’s Connaught lands in 1204 may have been
 made in consequence of some negotiations which were at that moment
 going on between Meiler, as John’s representative, and the King
 of Connaught, Cathal Crovderg. Cathal, it seems, offered to cede
 two-thirds of Connaught to John, on condition that the remaining third
 should be secured to himself and his heirs for a yearly payment of one
 hundred marks. John was willing to accept this offer, but he insisted
 that the portion of land to be ceded to him should be chosen by Meiler,
 and bade Meiler take care that it was “the best part, and that which
 contained the best towns, ports, and sites for castles.”[628] Possibly
 this claim of John’s to choose the land for himself was refused by
 Cathal; the negotiations certainly came to nothing, for in December
 1206 Cathal made another proposition. He would hold one-third of
 Connaught of King John for a hundred marks a year; out of the other
 two-thirds he would cede to John two cantreds, and for the remainder he
 would pay him a tribute of three hundred marks. John authorized Meiler
 to accept these terms, if he could get no better.[629] Whether the
 agreement was ever actually made, there is nothing to show; it was not
 likely to have any practical result. The invaders had evidently already
 gained some slight and precarious footing in eastern Connaught; but
 they had too much to do within their own March--as the dominions of the
 English crown in Ireland were called in those days[630]--to make any
 real progress westward for some years to come.
 
 [Sidenote: 1199–1205]
 
 The turbulence and lawlessness which prevailed in the Irish March
 reflected that of the Welsh March whence most of its original settlers
 had come. William de Braose and William de Burgh were far from being
 the only barons at feud with Meiler Fitz-Henry, either simply as a
 fellow-baron, or in his official capacity of representative of the
 king. In September 1199 John de Courcy and Walter de Lacy are mentioned
 in a royal writ as having acted together “for the destruction of our
 realm of Ireland.”[631] The reference probably is to their joint attack
 upon Leinster in 1195, which had been followed by the forfeiture of
 Lacy’s English and Welsh lands; these, however, he had regained in
 1198.[632] In 1203, as has been seen, he helped Meiler to expel William
 de Burgh from Limerick; and in February 1204 he was appointed one of
 four commissioners to assist Meiler in dealing with escheats.[633] His
 former ally, John de Courcy, had a safe-conduct to and from the king’s
 court in July 1202;[634] but he evidently did not come to terms with
 the king; and next year the Lacys turned against him; Hugh de Lacy,
 Walter’s younger brother, defeated him in a battle near Down and drove
 him out of Ulidia.[635] In September he had another safe-conduct to
 go to the king and return “if he does not make peace with us.”[636]
 This time it seems that he did “make peace,” but failed to fulfil its
 conditions. On August 31, 1204, he was summoned, on pain of forfeiture,
 to come to the king’s service “as he swore to come”; and Meiler was
 instructed, if the forfeiture should take place, to give to the two
 De Lacys the eight cantreds of De Courcy’s land which lay nearest
 to Meath.[637] De Courcy incurred the forfeiture; Meiler seemingly
 committed its execution to the De Lacys; they again attacked De Courcy,
 and drove him to take refuge in Tyrone;[638] and on May 2, 1205, King
 John granted Ulster to Hugh de Lacy, to hold “as John de Courcy held
 it on the day when Hugh defeated him.”[639] A few weeks later Hugh was
 belted earl of Ulster;[640] and at the end of June the triumph of the
 Lacys was completed by a royal order forbidding the chief justiciar to
 “move war against any man of the March” without the consent of Earl
 Hugh and his brother Walter.[641]
 
 [Sidenote: 1204]
 
 With the colleagues thus forced upon him Meiler was soon at strife. His
 strife with Walter de Lacy, indeed, had recommenced already. Walter’s
 appointment as a commissioner of escheats in 1204 had been made in
 connexion with a demand which John--anxious to prepare for an attack
 upon France, as well as to guard against an expected French invasion
 of England, and scarcely daring to ask his English subjects for more
 money--addressed to all his vassals in Ireland, that they would furnish
 him with an aid.[642] They undertook to do so; on September 1 the king
 thanked them for their services and their promises, and desired that
 the latter might be fulfilled.[643] At the same time he was taking
 measures for the security of the March and of his own authority there;
 on August 31 he had ordered Meiler to build a castle at Dublin,[644]
 and in September he bade the citizens do every man his part in helping
 to fortify the city.[645] In November he decided upon taking back into
 his own hands the city of Limerick and its cantred, being, as he said,
 advised by his barons of England that this step was necessary for the
 security of his domains in Connaught and Cork. It appears that William
 de Braose had called in the help of his son-in-law, the lord of Meath,
 for the keeping of this important border-post; the king’s orders for
 its surrender to the justiciar were addressed to Walter de Lacy and
 the bailiffs of William de Braose.[646] Walter seemingly refused to
 obey the order; Meiler, however, succeeded in taking possession of the
 city, “on account of which there arose a great war” between him and De
 Lacy,[647] with the result that John, to end their strife, took away
 the custody of Limerick from both of them, and restored it in August
 1205 to William de Braose.[648] Nineteen months later Walter de Lacy’s
 castle of Ludlow was seized for the Crown, {1207 March} and Walter
 was bidden to come and “stand to right” in the English court {1207
 April}.[649]
 
 [Sidenote: 1207]
 
 By that time Meiler was at strife with William de Braose again, and
 also with another Marcher lord of very different character from any
 of those with whom he had as yet had to deal. Meiler Fitz-Henry,
 though loyal to the king, was evidently not quite the man for the
 post of chief justiciar in Ireland. He was one of the few survivors
 of the first band of Norman-Welsh adventurers who had taken part in
 the invasion under Robert Fitz-Stephen. The royal blood of England
 and of Wales was mingled in his veins; he was in fact, though not
 in law, first cousin to Henry II.[650] The two young Lacys, now so
 often opposed to him, were cousins of his wife, a niece of the elder
 Hugh de Lacy.[651] He was, however, not one of the great barons of
 the March; he seems to have held in chief of the Crown nothing except
 three cantreds in Desmond granted to him by John in October 1200;[652]
 his principal possession was the barony of Leix in Ossory,[653] for
 which he owed homage to William the Marshal as lord of Leinster.
