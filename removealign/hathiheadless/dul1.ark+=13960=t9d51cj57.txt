 x"\ the pleafure of having gained a new admirer, 
 fhe could not forbear, after (lie came home, mak-' 
 ing fome refiedlicn on the value of her conquefc i— - 
 fhe had found nothing agreeable, either in his per- 
 
 fon, or converfation : the firft feemcd to her 
 
 ftiff and aukward, and looked, as if not made for 
 his cloaths ; and the latter, v/eak, romantic, and 
 bombafl: :-— in fine, he was altogether fuch as Oie 
 could not think of living with as a hufband, though 
 the rank and figure fhe was told he held in the world, 
 made her willing to receive him as a lover. — In 
 fine, though (he could not confent to facrifice her- 
 felf to his quality, '{he took a pride to facrilicc his 
 quality to her vanity. 
 
 No overtures of marriage having been made to 
 hef fince Mr. Munden began his court(bip, tpj that 
 gentlemaji grov/iiig, as fhe fancied at leaif, a little 
 too prefuming, on fin/Jing himfclf the only lover,

 his hopes. ---In this idea, fhe was far from repent- 
 ing her behaviour towards him the niglit before : 
 but how little foever fhe regarded what mortificati- 
 on fhe gave the men, (he always took care to treat 
 Iier own fex with a great deal of politenefs ; and 
 refietfting, that fhe had been guilty of an omifiion, 
 in not fending her fervant to excufe herfclf to the 
 ladies, who expected her, went herfelf in the morn- 
 ing to make her own apology. 
 
 In the mean time, Mr. Mundcn, who it is cer- 
 tain was very much out of humour, and impatient 
 to let her know fome part of the fcntiments her 
 nicfl'age had infpired l:im with, came to make her 
 a morning vifit, having fome bufinefs, which he 
 knew would detain him from waiting on her in the 
 
 afternoon. On finding fhe was abroad, be de- 
 
 r.rcd the maid to favour him with her lady's ftandifh, 
 which (lie accordingly br nglngto him, he fat down, 
 and without taking much confideration, wrote the 
 following leucr, and left it for her on the table. 
 
 To Mifs Betsy Thoughtless. 
 
 ' Madam, 
 
 AMidft the enchanting encouragement, with 
 v/hich you have been pleafed to admit my 
 fervices, I could not, without calling your ho- 
 nour and generofity in queftion, be altogether 
 void of hope, that yeu intended to afford them 
 one day, a recompence more ample than a bare 
 acceptance. 
 
 ' Judge then of my furprife, at the repulfc T 
 met with at Mrs. Modely's door. — I could not 
 think it any breach of the refpe£l I owe ycu, to

 Mifs Betfy, at her return home, found alfo ano- 
 ther billet directed for her, which they told her, had 
 been brought by a fervant belonging to Sir Frede- 
 rick Fineer ;— fhe gave that from Mr. Munden, 
 however, the preference of reading firft, not indeed 
 through choice, but chance, that happening to be 
 firft put into her hands.— -Asfoonas (he had looked 
 k over, (he laughed, and faid to herfelf, * The

 She wondered, as indeed ihe had good reafon, 
 that a man of his birth, and who it muft be fup- 
 pofed had an education fuitable to it, fhould exprels 
 himfelf in fuch odd terms ; but then flie was tempt- 
 ed to imagine, that it was only his over care to 
 pleafe her, had made him flretch his wit beyond its 
 natural extent, and that if he had loved her Itf?, 
 he would have been able to have told her fo in a 
 much better ftile. PoffefTed with this fancy, — 
 
 * What a ridiculous thing this love is ! ' faid ftie : 
 
 * What extravagancies does it tome times make 
 
 * men guilty of ! yet one never fees this mad- 
 
 * nefs in them after the}' become hufbar-ds ;--- 
 ' if I were to marry Sir Frederick, I do net doubt 
 
 * but he would foon recover his fenfes.' 
 
 How does a mind, unbrcke with c^res and dii- 
 appointments, entirely free from palHon, and per- 
 fedly at peace with itfeif, and with the world, im- 
 prove, and dwell on every thing, that affords the 
 leall matter for its entertainment r — — This gay

 But this fprightlinefs of humcur in Mifs BetJy, 
 
 (bon received a fad and fudden interruption ; 
 
 having fent, as fbe conftantly did every day, to en- 
 quire after the health of Mr. Goodman, her fcrvant 
 returned with an account, that he had expired that 
 
 morning. Though this was an event, which fhr,

 like a parent towards her, without being very deep- 
 ly afFe£ted with the news : fhe was then at din- 
 
 liiir, but threw down her knife and fork, rofe from 
 the table, and retired to her chamber and wept bit- 
 terly j the more violent emotions of grief were 
 
 foon airwaged, and her melancholy and dejedlion 
 of fpiriis continued much longer, and while it did 
 fo, fhe had the power of making the moft jufl: re- 
 ficdlions on the vain purfuiis, the fleeting pleafures, 
 and all the noife and hurry of the giddy world. — 
 Love, and all the impeitinencies which bear that 
 name, now appeared only worthy her contempt ; 
 and recolleet^ing, that Sir Frederick had mentioned 
 vifiting her that evening, fhe fent a fervant imme- 
 diately to Mrs. Modely's, defiring her to acquaint 
 t'iat gentleman, that fhe had juft loft a very dtar 
 f;iend, and was in loo much affliiflion to admit of 
 aiy company. 
 
 This being the day, on which Mr. Francis 
 Thoughtlcfs was expefted to be in London, this af- 
 fectionate filler perceiving, by his lafl letter to iier, 
 that his health was not perfe<Sily eftablifhed, was 
 under a very grsat concern, leflhefhould be put to 
 fome inconvenience by Mr. Goodman's death, for a. 
 prcjper lodging en his firft arrival ; but fhe foon 
 fcund her tender fears, on .this cccafion, altogether 
 groundlefs. 
 
 Th'-fe obje£^ions, which had hindered Mr. 7"ho- 
 mas Tnouahtlefs from taking her into his family, 
 had not the fam^e weight in relation to Mr. 
 Francis, whofe fex fet him above medlijig with thofe 
 dMTicllic concerns, the command of which he had 
 pvcn to another, and his reputation would fufFer no- 
 thing by being under the roof with the miftrefs of 
 his brotiier's amorous inclinations. 
 
 He vv-eiit to the inn where he knew the L e

 gave him all the demondrations of brotherly affec- 
 tion, that the place they were in would admit of ; 
 then conducted him to his houfe, and infilled that 
 he fliould not think of any other home, till 
 he was better provided for, and fettled in the 
 world. 
 
 A fervant belonging to the elder Mr. Thought- 
 lefs, was immediately difpatched to Mifs Bctfy, with 
 a letter from the younger, and it was from this man 
 that fhe rccei.ed the agreeable intelligence, that the 
 two brothers were together. — The terms in which 
 Mr. Francis wrote to her were thefe ;

 In the prefent fituation of Mifs Betfy's mind, flie

 on, than vi^hat fhe felt on this young gentleman's 
 arrival j but vi^hat enfued upon it will in due time

 CHAP. II. 
 
 Contains only fome few particulars of little moment 
 in themfelves^ but ferve to ufoer in matters of 
 inore importance, 
 
 R. Goodman, who, both living and dying, 
 had fmcerely at heart the welfare of all 
 with whom he had any concern, could not content 
 himfelfto leave the world, witht.ut giving to thofe, 
 who had been under his care, fuch advice as he 
 thought necefTary for their future happinefs. 
 
 Accordingly, the day preceding that which hap- 
 pened to be his lafl, he fent for Mr. Thoughtlefs, 
 nnd on his being come, and feated by his bedfide, 
 he took his hand, and began to remonftrate to him, 
 in the moft pathetic, though very gentle, terms, 
 how unjuftifiable to the eyes of heaven, and how 
 difreputable to thofe of the world, it was, to avow and 
 indulge, in the public manner he did, an unwar- 
 rantable flame. 
 
 ' I never was fevere,' faid he, * in cenfuring 
 *■ the frailties of youth and nature ; but think the 
 ' claim they have to pardon confifls chiefly in an 
 
 * endeavour to conceal them y when gloried in, 
 
 * they lofe the name of frailties, and become vices : 
 
 * befides, others by our example might be 
 
 * emboldened to offend, and if fo, what are we 
 
 * but acceflary to their faults, and anfwcrable for 
 
 * them, as well as for our own ? You are at

 — How great a pity would it be, that fuch a flock 
 of fortune's bleffings,— — fuch prefent benefits, 
 and fudi. glorious expectations, fhouid all be 
 fquandered in the purchafe of one guilty pleafure.* 
 He then proceeded to a fhort difcuffion of the 
 difference of a lawful and unlawful communica- 
 tion between the fexes ; he expatiated on the 
 
 wife and h'.udable inftitution of marriage ; the 
 
 folid comforts arifing from that ftate, in the choice 
 
 of a worthy partner; the many advantages' of 
 
 an honourable alliance ; — the ferene and lading 
 pleafures to be found in the fociety of a faithful, dil- 
 
 creet, and endearing companion. — ' A wife,' 
 
 faid he, with a figh, which the memory of his own 
 hard fate drew from him, *mayfome times be

 * her very character denies all confidence to be re-

 * Thefe, my dear friend,' continued he, ' arc 
 
 * truths, which I hope you will not wait for ex-

 It is probable Mr. Thoughtlefs did not reli{h this 
 
 admonition j

 admonition ; — he feemed, however, to take it in 
 good part, and returned for anfwer, that he Ihould 
 ever retain the moft grateful fenfe of the kind con- 
 cern he exprefled for him, and added, that what- 
 ever inconveniencies he might have been hurried in- 
 to, by an inadvertent paffion, he fhould always take 
 care not to become the dupe of any wcman. 
 
 Mr. Goodman then fell into fome difcourfe, con- 
 cerning the younger Mr. Thoughtlefs, and the el- 
 . <ler telling him, that, by his intereft, he procured 
 a commiflion for him on very eafy terms, that 
 worthy old gentleman appeared very much pleafed, 
 and faid, he hoped they would always live together 
 in that perfe6l amitv, which both good policy and 
 nature demands, between perfons of the fame blood. 
 ' And now,' continued he, * I have but one 
 thing more to recommend to you,— — and that 
 
 is in relation to your filler, Mifs Betfy. I doubt 
 
 not of her innocence, but I fear hercondudli— 
 her youth,--her beauty,--the gaiety of her tem- 
 per, and the little vanities of her fex, are every 
 day expofmg her to temptations fatal to reputa- 
 tion ; 1 wifh, therefore, (he were well mar- 
 ried ; — I know not how the courtfhip of Mr, 
 Truqworth happened to be broke off, perhaps oh 
 fome trifling occafion, either on the one or the 
 other fide :~if fo, 'tis likely Mr. Francis, when 
 he comes to town, may bring about a reconci- 
 liation. --According to my judgment of mankindj 
 (he cannot make a more deferving ehoice.— There 
 is another gentleman who now makes his ad- 
 drelTcs to her,— his name is Munden ;- -but I 
 know nothing of his charafler,— he never applied 
 to me, nor did (he confult me on the affair ;---it 
 will however be a brother's part in you, to en- 
 quire how far he may be worthy of her.' 
 Perceiving Mr. Thoughtlefs liftcned to him^ 
 With a good deal of attention, he went on ;--* I 
 
 ' (hould

 « fliould alfo think it right,' faid he, ' that while 
 
 * file remains in a fingk uate, Ihe fliould be board- 
 ' ed in fome focial, reputable family ;--I do not 
 ' like this living by herrelf,--ber huaiour is too 
 ' volatile to endure folitude ; ihe muil have her 
 
 * amufements ; aud the want of them at home, 
 
 * naturally carries her in fearch of them broad :-.-- 
 
 * I could wifii,' added he, * that you would tell - 
 *. her what I have faid to you upon this fu bjed ; 
 
 ' fhe is convinced I am her friend, J believe has- 
 
 * fome regard for me, and it may be, my dying 
 
 * admonitions will have greater efFe£t upon her, 
 ' than all file has heard from me before.' 
 
 Mr. Goodman, after this, beginning to grow 
 extremely faint, and altogether. unable to hold any 
 farther difcourfe, the brother of Mifs Eetfy Judged 
 it convenient to retire, afluring the other, as he 
 took his leave, that no part of what he had faid, 
 fliould be loft upon him. 
 
 '^I'hough the promife he Jiad made Mr. Good- 
 man) v/as chiefly di£fated by his complaifance, yet 
 it was not totally forgot after he had left him.- — 
 As to what that worthy gentleman had faid, in re- 
 lation to his own manner of living, he thought he 
 had talked well, but he had talked like an old man, 
 and that- it was time enough for him to part with 
 his pleafures, whe-n he had no longer any inclina- 
 tion topurfue them ;---but what had been alledged 
 to him concerning his fifi^^er's conduft, made a much 
 deeper impreffion on his mind :--he confidcred, 
 that the honour of a family depended greatly on the 
 female part of it, and therefore refolved to omit 
 nothing in his power, to prevent Mifs Betfy from 
 being caught by any fnares, that might be laid to 
 entrap her innocence. 
 
 lie communicated to Mr. Francis Thoughtlefs 
 on his arrival, all that Mr. Goodman had faid to 
 him on this fccre, and his own fenciments upon it : 
 --- that young gentleman was entirely of his bro- 
 ther's 
 

<#PG# 20>
12 nt H IS TOR Y of 
 
 ther's opinion in this point, and they both agreed, 
 that marriage was the only fure refuge from tcmp- 
 tition, for a young woman of Mifs Betfy's difpo- 
 li.lcn and humour. -"They bad a very Ions; and 
 pretty Terious converfation on this head, the rduit 
 of which was, that they (houM go together to her, 
 and each exert all the inP.uence he had over her, 
 in order to draw from '-ier fome farther eclaircife- 
 ment intentions, 1 1 jan could yet be gathered of her 
 from her-behaviour. 
 
 Mifs Betfy, who little fufpeiled their defign, re- 
 ceived them with all the tendernefs that could be 
 expected from a fiiier, efpecially her brother 
 Frank, whofe return after {\:) long an abfence, gave 
 her, in reality, an infinite fatisfa6tion j but (he had 
 fcarce time to give him all the welcomes, with which 
 her heart overflowed, before the elder Mr.Thought- 
 lefs fell on the topic of Mr. Goodman, and the 
 misfortune they fuftained, in the lofs of fo good a 
 friend ; after which, ' He has left you a legacy, 
 ' fifter,' faid he:--* A legacy !' cried flie, * pray 
 of what kind ?' * Such a one/' replied he, ' as 
 
 * perhaps you will not be very well pleafed in re- 
 
 * ceiving, nor v/ould I chufe to deliver it, but for 
 ' two reafons ;--firft, that the injundlions of a dy- 
 ' ing friend are not to be difpenfed with \ and fe- 
 ' condly, that it is of a nature, I fear, you ftand 
 ' in too much need of.' 
 
 Mifs Betfy, whofe ready wit made her prefently 
 comprehend the meaning of thefe words, replied 
 with fome fmartncfs, that whatever fhe flood in 
 need of, fhe (hauld certainly receive v/ith pleafure, 
 and he might have fpared himfelf the trouble of a 
 prelude, for any thing that could be delivered by 
 him, or bequeathed to iier by Mr. Goodman. 
 
 He then told her, how that gentleman, the day 
 before his death, had fent for him, ' For no other 
 ' purpofe/ faid he, ' than to tdlk to me 0.1 your 
 
 ' account;

 * account, and to exhort me as your brother,, 
 
 * and now your guardian, to have a watchful eyi 
 
 * over all your adtions ;---to remind you of fome 
 ' inadvertencies of the part, and to warn you a- 
 
 * gainft falling into the like for the future :---!' -rry 
 
 * I am, to find myfelf under a necaflity of fpeakii.g 
 
 * to you in this manner; but harfn as it may ftem 
 
 * at prefent, I doubt not, but you will hereafter 
 'own, is a proof of the greateft afFe(5:ion I could 
 
 * (hew you.' He then repeated to her, all that 
 Mr. Goodman had faid to him, in relation to herj 
 to which he alfo added many thin?^s of his own, 
 which he thought might ferve to Areogthcn, an3 
 enforce the arguments made ufe of by the other. 
 
 It is impoilible to defcribe the various and dif- 
 turbed emotions, which difcovered themfelves in 
 the countenance of Mils Betfy, during the whole 
 time her brother was fpeaking y—iha looked ex:- 
 tremely grave, at the manner in v/hich he ufhered 
 what he had to deliver to her from Mr. Goodman, 
 
 -appeared confounded and perplexed at what 
 
 {he heard tliat gentleman had faid concerning Mr. 
 Trueworth, — v/as quite peevifn at the mention cf 
 Mr. Munden, but v/hen told of the dangers to 
 which {he was expofeJ, by living alone, and truft- 
 ed with the management of herfelf, her eyes fpark- 
 led Vv'ith difdain and rage, at a remonftrancc file 
 looked upon as fo unneceflarv and To t;njuft-. 
 
 If this mefiage had been fent to her by any o- 
 ther, than Mr. Goodman, whofe memory, on 
 account of the benefits fhe had received from him, 
 ; was prccicus to her; or had it been repeated by 
 any other mouth than that of a brother, (be had 
 certainly vented the indignation (he was pofieffed, 
 
 * of, in the moft bitter terms ; but gratitude, refpedi-, 
 and love, denying her this remedy, (he burfl into a 
 fiood of tears. . — ' Good God !' cried (he, ' what

 ' much lefs to call my virtue in queftion.' 
 
 The two brothers feemed very much moved at 
 the agonies that they faw her in, cfpecially the el- 
 •der, who repenting be had gone fo far, took her in 
 his arms, and tenderly embracing her, * My dear 
 ' fifler,' faid he, * you wrong your friends, while 
 ' you imagine yourfelf wronged by them ; — your 
 
 * reputation, I hope, is clear ; your virtue not 
 
 * fuiped^ed ; it is not to accufe you of any guilt, 
 
 * but to prevent your innocence from becoming a 
 ' prey to the guilt of others, that Mr. Goodman 
 
 * fcnt you his dying admonition, or that I took up- 
 
 * on me to deliver it.' 
 
 Mr. Francis Thoughtlefs feconded what the o- 
 ther had faid, and buth joining their endeavours to 
 pacify the late tempeft of her mind, flie foon re- 
 covered th:U good humour and chearfulnefs, which 
 was too natural to her to be long fufpended by anj 
 accident whatfoever. 
 
 * I flattered myfelf,' faid the younger of thefe 
 £entlen;en, ' that cautions of this kind would have 
 ^ been altogether unnecefiary, and that before now 
 
 * you would have been difpofed of to a man, under 
 
 * whofe protection all that is dear to your fcx had 
 -♦ been fecure ; 1 need not tell you,' continued 
 
 he, * that I mean Mr. Trueworth.' 
 
 Mifs Betfy looking a little confufcd, and not 
 making any reply, the elder Mr. Thoughtlefs im- 
 mediately took up the word, and faid, he had heard 
 fo high a character of that gentleman's merit, that 
 he had wifbed for few things with more ardency, 
 than the honour of being allied to him, and that 
 he never CQuU find tut what objcdlion his fifttr 
 
 had.

 To this Mifs Betfy made anfwer, though noC 
 without fome diforder, and hefitation in her fpeech, 
 -—that fhe had never made any objecSxion, cither 
 to his perfon or qualification ; — —but that (he did 
 not care to marry yet awhile, and he had not love 
 enough to wait the event of her refolution in that 
 
 point ; that, befidcs, their humours did not fuit, 
 
 and there was little likelihood they would agree 
 better after marriage j — that tiiere had been a little 
 pique between them ;---th.-it he gave hinifclf airs 
 of refenting fomething fhe had faid, and theieupon 
 had fent her a very impertinent letter fince v/hich 
 fhe hid never feen him ;--- * fo that,' added (lie, 
 
 * our breaking off" acquaintance is v,hoUy owing to 
 *himfelf.' 
 
 Mr. Francis not doubting but thrs letter would 
 explain what he fo much defired to know the truth 
 of, cried out to her haftily, to let him fee it ;— 
 Mifs Betfy already repented, that fhe had mention- 
 ed fuch a thing, as ihe was confcious there were 
 fomeexpieffions in it, which would greatly coun- 
 tenance the difagreeable remonflrances flie had jud 
 now received ; but fhe wanted artifice to pretend, 
 (he had either lofl, or burnt it, and went that irr- 
 itant to her cabinet, where eafily finding it, flie 
 gave it into her brother's hands, with thcfc words^ 
 
 * he reproaches me,' faid fhe, ' with things I knovw 
 *■ nothing of, and in terms, which, I think, do not 
 
 * very well become th^paliion he pretended to hav« 
 *"for me.' 
 
 ' That he once loved yon,' faid Mr. Fran- 
 cis, cooly, ' I am very certain;-— how iiis fciV' 
 '■ timents may be changed, and the rtafons o^ 
 
 * their being fo, thi« may, perhaps, give ma

 difTatisfied with her, for having given any caufe for 
 the rcfle<flions contained in it. 
 
 ' { fee very well', Aiid he, returning her the let-

 Here Mifs Betfy 's fpirit roufed itfelf, in fpitc of

 THOUGH Mifs Betfy was very confcious of 
 the merits of Mr. Trueworth, and equally 
 convinced of the fri^ndfhip her brother PVancis 
 had for him, and had therefore doubted not, but 
 when that young, gentleman fliould arrive, he wouFd

 feemed to her,, he had teflified on the occafion. 
 
 She eafiTy perceived the two brothers had con- 
 fulted together, before they came to her, in what 
 manner they fbould behave towards her ; and this 
 {he looked upon as a fort of proof, that they in- 
 tended to afTume an authority over her, to which 
 
 they had no claim. * The love I have for them,*^

 diredtion ? Poor Frank has g.iven me proofs, 
 
 that I am very dear to him, and, ! believe, my 
 brother Thoughtlefs is not wanting in natural af- 
 fedion for mc ; why then fhould I r-cje£l the 
 council of two friends, whofe fuicerity there is 
 
 not a poflibi'iity of fufpccSting ? They know 
 
 their fex, and the dangers to which ours are ex- 
 pofed, by the artifices of bafe defigning men : — 
 I have had fome efcapes, v/hich I ought always 
 to remember, enough to keep me from falling 
 
 into the like ugly accidents again ; how near 
 
 was I to everlafting ruin, by flighting the warning 
 given me by Mr. Trueworth !' 
 This refle(^ion bringing into her mind many paf- 
 fages of her behaviour towards that gentleman, fhe 
 could not forbear juftifying his conduct, and con- 
 demning her own : ' 1 have certainly ufed him 
 
 ' ill,' purfued fhe, with a figh, * and if he fliouM 
 ' return, and forgive what is paft, I think I ought, 
 ' in gratitude, to reward his love !' 
 
 She was in this contemplating mood when her 
 fervant told her, that Mrs. Modely had been to 
 ■wait upon her, but on hearing her brothers were 
 with her, went away, faying, fhe would come 
 again, which {lie now was, and begged to fpcak 
 W'i:h her. 
 
 Mifs Bctfy was in this moment juf^ beginning to 
 feel fome fort of pleafure in the idea of Mr. True- 
 worth's renev/ing his addrefTes, and was a little 
 peevifh at the interruption ; — ilie ordered, however, 
 that the woman fnould come up, — * ^Vel], A^rs.

 thefe high-flown lines :

 The glare of pomp and equipage, the pleafure of 
 having it in her power of taking the upper- hand of 
 thofe of her own rank, and of vying with thofe of 
 a more exalted one, it is certain had very potent 
 charms for her ; but then there was a delicacy in 
 her nature, that would not fuffer the defire of at- 
 taining it to be altogether predominant :— — the 
 thoughts of being facrificed to a man for whom it 
 was impoITible for her to have either love, oreftecm;

 She was now beginning to pleafe herfelf with the

 that evening, would behave at fight of his new rival, 
 and how Sir Frederick Fineer would bear the pre- 
 fence of a man, whom (he was refolved to ihew

 tho' fhe happened to be difappointed in her expe<Sa- 
 -tions in this, fhe did not want other fufficient mat-

 Sir Frederick, to fhew the impatience of his paf- 
 fion, came very foon after dinner ; — fhe received 
 him with as grave an air as flie could poilibly put on, 
 but it was not in her power, nor indeed wou'd have 
 been in any one's elfe, to continue it for any long 
 
 time : his convcrfation was much of a piece with 
 
 his letters, and his a(Slions, even more extravagant.- 
 Never was fuch an Orlando Furiofo in love;— 
 -jon his firfl approach, he had indeed the boldnefs to 
 take one of her hands and put it to his mouth, but 
 .afterwards whatever he faid to her was on his knees; 
 — he threw himfclf proftrate on the carpet before 
 her, grafp'd her feet, and alternately kifled each 
 Ihoe, with the fame vehemence, as he could have 
 ■done her lips, aixl as much devotion as the pilgrims 
 at Rome do the Pantofle of his Holinefs. — Darts '!

 that (he could not forbear fometimes returning it 
 with a fmile, which, in fpite of her endeavours to 
 preferve a ferious deportment, difFufeJ a gaiety

 the change he had obferved in her looks for an in-

 behaviour, he acied and re-3(5ted over all his fop- 
 peries, and felt as much fecret pride in repeating 
 them, as a celebrated finger on the ftage docs in 
 obeying the voice of an encore. 
 • It is probable, hov.'ever, that he would have 
 continued in them long enough to have tired Mlfa 
 Betfy fo much, as to have made her give him fume

 I S S Betfj, one would think, had now fuf- 
 ficient matter to employ her meditations, on 
 the Tcore of thofe two lovers, who at prefent laid 
 clofe fie»e to her, neither of whom Ihe was willino; 
 tapart entirely with, and to retain either (lie found 
 
 required feme management : ^Mr. A-lunden was 
 
 beginning to grow impatient at the little progrefs 
 his long courtfhip had made on her afteciions ; and 
 Sir Frederick Fineer, on the other hand, was for 
 bringing things to a conclufion at once : — {he was 
 alfo every day receiving tranfient addre{res from 
 many others, which, though not meant ferioufly 
 by thofe that made them, nor taken fo by her, 
 ferved occsifionally to fill up any vacuum in her 
 
 mind ; yet was it not in the power of love,— -- 
 
 gallantry, or any other amufement, to drive the 
 memory of Mr. Trueworth wholly out of her head ; 
 which (hews, that to 3 woman of fenfe, a man of 
 real merit, even though he is not loved, can never 
 be totally indifferent. 
 
 But (he was at this time more than ordinarily 
 
 agitated on that gentleman's account > fhe 
 
 doubted not but her brother Frank, either had, or 
 would (hortly have a long conference with him, on 
 the fubje£^ of his defifiing his vifits to her, and 
 could not keep herfelf from feeling fome palpitations 
 for the event; for though (he was not refolved to'

 moft valuable prize of all that her beauty had ever 
 gained. 
 
 Thus unreafonabic, and indeed unjuft, was (lie 
 in the affairs of love: in all others {he was hu- 
 mane, benevolent, and kind j but here covetous, 
 even to greedinefs, of receiving all, without any 
 
 intention of making the leaft return. In fine, 
 
 the time was not yet come, when fhe (hould be ca- 
 pable of being touched with that herfelf, which (he 
 took fo much pride to infpire in others. 
 
 Though fhe could not love, (he was pleafed 
 with being loved:-- -no man, of what degree or 
 circumflance focver, could offend her by declaring 
 bimfclf her admirer ; and as much as (he defpifed Sir 
 Frederick Fineer for his romantic manner of ex- 
 prcffing the paffion he profefTed for her, yet to have 
 mifTed him out of the number of her train of cap- 
 tives, would have been little lefs mortification to 
 her, than the lofs of a favourite lover would have 
 been to fome other women. 
 
 That enamorato of all enamoratoes, would not, 
 however, fuffer the flame, which he flattered him- 
 felf with having kindled in her, to grow cool, and

 How acceptable to a vain mind, is even the mean- 
 eft teftimony of admiration !- If Mifs Betfy was 
 
 not charmed with the elegance of this ofFerinp;, ihe 
 was, at leaft, very v/ell pleafed with the pams he 
 
 took in compofing it. In the humour fhe then 
 
 was, (lie would perhaps have rewarded the labour 
 of his brain, with giving hin; an opportunity of 
 kiffing her fhoe a fecond time, but ilie expet^ed 
 her brother Frank about the hour he mentioned, 
 v/ith fome intelligence of Mr. Trueworth, and had 
 engaged to pafs the evening abroad, as has been al- 
 ready mentioned. 
 
 She fent, however, a very complaifant mc-liV.ge 
 >by the fervant, who brought the letter ; — fne or- 
 dered he fhould come up into her dining-room, 
 and then, with a great deal of fvvcetnefi;, defired

 were jufl come to town, therefore intreated he 
 would (.leftr the honour he intended her, 'till fome 
 other time. 
 
 Mr. Francis Thotightlefs did indeed call upon 
 her, as ihc imagined he would ; — he had been at 
 the lodgings of Mr. Trueworth, but that gentleman 
 happened to be abroad at the time he went, and l>e 
 was now obliged to go v/ith his brother on fome 
 bufinefs relating to the commiflion he was about to 
 purchafe, fo could not (lay long enough with her to 
 enter into any converfation of moment. 
 
 Mifs Betfy had nov/ full two hours upon her 
 liands after her brother left her, to which (he had 
 appointed Mr. Munden to come to condu6l her to 
 the country-dancing, and as (he had not feen Mifs 
 Mabel for a good while, and had heard that lady 
 had inade her feveral vifits whvn (lie was not at 
 home to receive them, fhe thought to take this op- 
 portunity of having nothing cli'c to do, to return 
 part of the debt, which civility demanded from her 
 to her friend.-— Accordingly (lie fet out in a hack- 
 ney coach, but met with an accident hy the way, 
 which not only difappointcd her intentions, but 
 likewife ftruck a firange damp on the gaiety of her 
 fpiiits. 
 
 As they were driving pretty fafl thro' a narrow 
 ftre?t, a gentleman's chariot run full againft them, 
 widi fuch rapidity, that both received a very great 
 fbock, infomuch that the wheels were locked, and 
 it was not without fome difHculty, and the afTift- 
 ance of fcvcral people, who feeing what had hap- 
 pened ran out of their fhops and houfes, that the 
 coachmen were able to keep their horfcs from go- 
 ing on ; which had they done, both the machii^cs 
 
 muft inevitably have been torn to pieces : there 
 
 were too gentlemen in the chariot, who inimedi- 
 
 iitcly jumped out ; Mifs Betfy fcreaming, ?.nd 
 
 tr;g!ited almolt to death, was alfo helped out of the

 coach- by a very civil tradefman, before whofe door 
 
 the accident had happened ; he led her into his 
 
 fhop, and made her fit down, while his wife ran 
 to fetch a ghfs of water, and funic hartlhorn drops. 
 
 Her extreme terror had hindered her from dif- 
 jcovering who was in the chariot, or whether any 
 one was there, but the gentlemen having crofi'cd 
 the way, and come into the fame (hop, fhe pre- 
 fently knew the one to be Sii Bazil Loveit, and thje 
 other Mr. Truevvorth ; her furprize at the fight of 
 the latter was fuch as might have occafioned fome 
 jailiery, if it had not been concealed under that 
 which {he had fuftained before ;— — Sir Bazil ap- 
 proached her with a refpedtful bow, and made a 
 handfome apology for the fault his man had com- 
 mitted, in not giving way when a lady was in the 
 coach ; to which fne modeftly replied, that there 
 could be no fault where there was no defign of of- 
 fending. Mr. Trueworth then drav/ing near, 
 
 with a very cold and referved air told lier, he hoped 
 fne would receive no prejudice by the accident. 
 
 * I believe the danger is now over,' faid {he,ftruck 
 to the very heart at finding herfdf accofled by him 
 in a manner fo widely different from that to which 
 Ihc had been accuflomed : — — -fcarce had flie the 
 fortitude to bear the fhnck it gave her ; but fum- 
 monii>2 to her aid all that pride and difdain could 
 fupply her with, to prevent him from perceiving 
 how much fne v/as affected by his behaviour :— I 
 ' could not, however,' purfued fhe, with a tone of 
 voice perfectly ironical, ' have cxpefted to receive 
 
 * any confolation under this little difafter from Mr. 
 
 * Trueworth; — I imagined, Sir, that feme weeks 
 
 * ago you had been repofing yourfelf in thedelight- 
 
 * ful bowers, and fvveet receffes of your country 
 feat. — How often have I heard ycu repeat with

 " Bear me, ye gods ! to UmbnVs gentle feats, 
 
 *' Or hide me in fweet Bayia's foft retreats. 
 
 * Yet ftill I find you in this noify, hurtling 
 
 • town.' — 'She concluded thefe words with a forced 
 fmilc i which Mr. Trueworth taking no notice of, 
 replied, with the fame gravity as before, * I pur- 
 ' pofed indeed, madam, to have returned to Ox- 
 
 • fordjiire, but events then unforefeen have de- 
 
 • tained me.' 
 
 While they were fpcaking. Sir Bazil recolle£ling 
 the face of Mifs Betly, which till now he had not 
 done, cried, * I tiiink, madam, I have had the 
 
 • honour of feeing you before this.' * Yes, Sir 
 
 ' Bazil,' replic-' the, knowing very well he meaned 
 at Mifs Forward's, ' you favv me once in a place, 
 ' where neither you, nor any one tlfe, will ever 
 
 • fee rae again, but I did not then know the cha- 
 
 • rad^er of the perfon I vifited ;' To which Sir Ba- 
 zil only replying, that he believed flae did not, Mr. 
 Triie'.voith immediately rejoined, that the moft 
 cautious might be onci; deceived. 
 
 The emphafis with which he uttered the word 
 once, made Mifs Betfy fee, tiiat he bore flill in 
 mind the fccond error fiic had been guilty of, in 
 vifiting that woman ; but flie had no time to give 
 any otlier anfwcr than a look of fcorn and indigna- 
 tion, Sir Bazil's footman telling him, the chariot 
 was now at liberty, and had received no damage ; 
 on which the gentlcincn took their leave of her, 
 Mr. IVuewoi th fncwing no more concern in doing 
 fo, than Sir Bazil himfelf, or any one would have 
 done, f who never had more than a mere curfory 
 acquaintance with her. 
 
 She would not be perfuaded to go into the coach 
 again, much Icfs could ihe think of going en her 
 intended vifit, but defiied a chair to be called, and 
 went diredtly home, in order to give vent to thofe

 entertainment of the reader. 
 
 HO W great foever was the fhock Mifs Betfy 
 had fuftained in this interview with Mr. 
 Trueworth, neither did he think himfelf much in- 
 debted to fortune, for having thrown her in his 
 ■vvay ; — he had once loved her to a very high de- 
 gree, and though the belief of her unworthinefs,— 
 the fond endearments of one woman, — and the real 
 merits of another, had all contributed to drive that 
 paffion from his breaft, yet as a wound but lately 
 clofed is apt to bleed afrefh, on every little accident, 
 (b there required no lefs than the whole Hock of the 
 beautiful and difcreet Mifs Harriot's perfedions, 
 to defend his heart from feeling anew fome part 
 of its former p&in, on this fudden and unexpected 
 attack. 
 
 Happy was it for him, that his judgment con- 
 curred with his prefent inclination^, and that he had 
 fuch unqueflionable reafons for juftifying the tran- 
 fition he had made of his affedions from one object 
 to another, elfe might he have rekipfed into a flame, 
 which, if ever it had been attended with any true 
 felicity, muft have been purchafed at the expence of 
 an infinity of previous difquiets. 
 
 He was now become extremely converfant with 
 
 the family of Sir Bazil, vifited there almoft 
 
 every day was well received by both the fifters, 
 
 and had many opportunities of penetrating into the 
 real fcntiments and difpofitions of Mifs Harriot, 
 which he found to be fuch as his mcft fanguine 
 wilhes could have formed for the woman to be bleft 
 
 with. 
 

<#PG# 42>

 with, whom he wouid make choice of for a wife.— 
 When he compared the fteady temper, the af- 
 fability, the eafy, unaffcded chearfuhiefs, mix- 
 ed with a becoming refcrve, which that young la- 
 dy teftified in all her words and aftions, with the 
 
 capricious turns,: the pride,— —the giddy light- 
 
 nefshehad obferved in the behaviour of Mifs Betfy, 
 his admiration of the one was increafed by his dif- 
 approbation of the other. 
 
 How great a pity was it, therefore, that a young 
 lady, like Mifs Betfy, fo formed by heaven and na- 
 ture to have rendered any man compleatly happy in 
 pofTelfing her, inferior to her fair competitor, nei- 
 ther in wit, beauty, or any perfonal, or acquired 
 
 endowment, her inclinations no lefs pure, — her 
 
 fentiments as noble her difpofition equally gene- 
 rous and benign, fliould, through her own inad- 
 vertency, deftroy all the merit of fo many amiable 
 qualities, and for the fake of indulging the wanton 
 vanity of attracting univerfal admiration, forfeit, in 
 reality, thofe juft pretenfions to it, which other- 
 wife ibe had been entitled from the deferving and 
 difcerning ftw ! 
 
 Mr. Trueworth, as the reader may have ob- 
 ferved, did not all at once withdraw his afFe£tion8 
 from the firft objedt of them, nor tranfmit them 
 to a fecond, but on very juftifiable motives. — The 
 levity of Mifs Betfy, and other branches of ill 
 condu6t, had very much weaned her from his heart, 
 before the wicked artifices of Mifs Flora had ren- 
 dered her quite contemptible in his opinion, and had 
 not wholly devoted himfelf to the beauties of Mifs 
 Harriot, 'till he was well convinced the perfections 
 of her mind were fuch as could not fail of fecuring 
 the conquefl: which her eyes had gained. 
 
 He did not however prefently declare him.felf ;-- 
 he faw the friendftiip between the two filters wojld 
 be fomewhat of an obftacle to hie hopes i«*— he 
 
 had

 had heard that Mifs Harriot had rejeded feveral ad- 
 vantageous propofals of marriage, merely becaufe 
 {lie would not be feparatcd from Mrs. Wellair j— 
 he alfo found, that Sir Bazil, though for what rea- 
 fon he could not gucfs, feemed not very defirous of 
 
 having his fifter difpofed of; the^only probable 
 
 way therefore, he thought of obtaining bis wiflbes, 
 was to conceal them, 'till he found the means of 
 infinuating himfelf fo far into the good graces, both 
 of the one and the other, as to prevent them from 
 oppofing whatever endeavours he fliould make to 
 engage their fifter to liften to his fuit. 
 
 The flratagcm had all the effect for which it was 
 
 put in practice : the intimacy he had long ago 
 
 contradled with Sir Bazil, now grew into fo pcrfeiSl 
 a fricndftiip, that he fcarce fufFered a day to pafs 
 without an invitation to this houfe.— — -Mrs. Wel- 
 lair exprcfled the higheft efteem and liking of his 
 converfation, and Mifs Harriot herfelf, not ima- 
 gining of what confequence every word that fell 
 from her was to him, faid athoufand obliging things 
 on his account, particularly one day, after they had 
 been finginga two-part fong together, * How oftenj* 
 cried fhe to her fifter, * fhall we wilh for this gen- 
 ' tleman, when we get into the country, to adl 
 * the principal part in our operas !' 
 
 All this he returned in no other manner, than 
 any man would have done, who had no farther 
 aim than to fhew his wit and gallantry :— fo much 
 of his happinefs, indeed, depended upon the event, 
 that it behoved him to be very cautious how be 
 proceeded ; and it is likely he would not have ven- 
 tured to throw off the mafk of indifference fo foon 
 as he did, if he had not been emboldened to it by an 
 unexpected accident. 
 
 Among the number of thofc, who vifited the 
 Afters of Sir Bazil, there was a young lady called

 On account of the death of an uncle, wlio had left

 worth, though fhe behaved towards him in a man- 
 ner, which would have been flattering enough to a- 
 man of more vanity, or who had been lefs en- 
 grofled by the perfection of another. 
 
 By what odd means does Fortune fometimes 
 bring about thofe things (he is determined to ac- 
 complilh ?-— Who could have thought this lad}', 
 with whom Mr. Trueworth had no manner of 
 concern, and but a flight actjuaintance, ftiould even- 
 unknowing it herfelf, become the happy inftrument 
 of having that done for him, which he knew not 
 very well how to contrive for himfelf j-— yet fo 
 it proved, in effeif^, as the reader will prcfently 
 perceive. 
 
 Happening to call one morning on Sir Badl while 
 he was dreilng, ' O ! Trueworth,' faid he, * I am 
 
 * glad you have prevented nie ; fo? I was juft going 
 
 * to your lodgings :••— I have fomething to acquaint

 * ' Why you have made a conquer!: here it.Tecms,' 
 refumed Sir Bazil, ' and may (ay witji Ca^far,

 ' You argue very reafonably indeed,' replied Mr. 
 Trueworth ; * but pray,' purfucd he, ' as you are

 let you into the fecret, my heart was engaged be- 
 fore I ever faw her face, and my perfon had been 
 fo too by this time, but for an unlucky rub in 
 my way.' 
 
 ' What ! Sir Bazil, honourably in love,' cried 
 Mr. Trueworth.---' Aye, CKarles, there is no re- 
 fifting deftiny,' anfwercd he; ---' I that have 
 ranged through half the fex in fearch of pleafure, 
 — -doated on the beauty of one,— the wit of 
 another, admired by turns their different charms, 
 have at laft found one in whom all I could wifh 
 in woman is compriz'd ; and to vv'hom I am un- 
 alterably fixed, beyond even, I think, a pofllbility 
 of change.' 
 
 ' May I be trulled wiih the name of this admi' 
 rable perfon,' faid Mr. Trueworth, ' and what 
 impedes your happinefs .'"-—'' You fhall know 
 all,' replied Sir Bazil ;---* in the firft place, fhe 
 is called Mifs Mabel.'---* What! Mifs Mabel 
 of Bury-ftreet,' cried Mr. Trueworih baftily r' 
 -' The fame,' replied Sir Bazil : — ' you know 
 her then r'---I have feen her,' faid Mr. True- 
 worth, in company with a lady I vifited fome 
 time ago, and believe flie is, in reality, the 
 original of that amiable picture you have been 
 drawing.' 
 
 * It njoices me, however, that you approve 
 my choice,' faid Sir Bazil ; ' but her father is, 
 without exception, the moft fordid, avaritious 
 wretch breathing ;---he takes more pleafure in 
 counting over his bags, than in the happinefs of 
 an only child j— he fecms glad of an alliance with

 * minutiun of his fubftance, while he lives. 
 
 * Thefs,' continued he, ' are the only terms on 
 
 * which he will give his confent, and this it is, which 
 
 * has {'o long delayed my marriage.' 
 
 Mr. Trueworth could not here forbear making 
 fome refle6tions on the cruelty and injuftice of th<ifc 
 parents, who rather than divide any part of their 
 treafures ^vith their children, fufFer them to let flip 
 the only crifis that could make their happinefs. 
 ' — — After which. Sir Bazil went on in bis difr 
 courfe. 
 
 * It is not/ faid he, ' that I would not gladly 
 accept my charming girl on the conditions the 
 old mifer offerSj cr even without any future hopes 
 of what he promifes to do for her ; but J am fo 
 unhappily circumftanced as to be under a neceffity 
 
 of having ready money with a wife :- old Sir 
 
 Bazih my father, gave my elder fifter fix thou- 
 fand pounds on her marriage with Mr. Wellair, 
 and, 1 fuppofe to fhew his affedion to both his 
 daughters was equal, bequeathed at his death the 
 fame fum to Harriot, and this to be charged on 
 theeftate, notwithftanding it was then under fome 
 other incumbrances : — (he can make her demand, 
 either on coming of age, or on the day of marri- 
 age, which ever happens firft j the one indeed is 
 three years diftant, fhe being but eighteen, but 
 who knows how foon the other may happen ? — 
 ^ ris true, flie feems at prefent quite averfe to

 * tallc in that ftrain ; but when once the favourite 
 
 * man comes in view, away at once with refolution 
 
 * and virginity.' 
 
 Mr. Trueworth now ceafed to wonder at the lit- 
 tle fatisfaftion Sir Bdzil had fhevvn, on any dilcourfe 
 that cafually happened concerning love or marri; ge 
 to Mils Harriot ; and nothing could be more lucky 
 
 for him than- this difcovery of the caufe, he 
 
 found by it that one obftacle, at Icaft, to his hopes 
 n^.ight eafily be removed, and that it was in his own 
 jv^ver to convert entirely to his intereft, that 
 \v!iich had feemed to threaten the greatefl oppofition 
 tu ir. 
 
 A moment's confideration fufficed to make him 
 kr.ow what he ought-todo, and that a more favour- 
 able conjundlure could not poJTibly arrive, for his 
 tleclaring the pafTion he had fo long concealed : — 
 
 * Mcthinks, Sir Bazil,' faid he, atter a very fhort 
 paufe, ' there is not the leaft grounds for any ap- 
 
 * prehenfions of the inconvenience you mention : 
 
 * whoever has in view the poficflion of Mifs 
 
 * Harriot, mufc certainly be too much taken up with 
 
 * his approaching happinefs to think of any thing 
 ' befides.' 
 
 * Ah friend,' cried Sir Bazil, * you talk like 
 
 * one ignorant of the world.' I talk like one 
 
 * who truly loves,' replied Mr. Trueworth, ' and 
 
 * is not ignorant of the merit of her he loves j — 
 ' and now,' continued he, perceiving Sir Bazil look- 
 ed a little furprifcd, * I will exchange fecrets with 
 ' vou, and for the one you have repofed in me, will 
 ' entruPc you with another, which has never yet ef- 
 < caped my lips : — I love your charming fifter ; — 
 « the firft moment I beheld her, made me her ador- 
 
 * er ; her affability, ——her modeft fweetnefs, 
 
 * her unafFeded wit, her prudence, 
 
 * the

Mifs Betsy Thoughtless. 41 
 
 * tlie thoufand virtues of her mind have fince con- 
 
 * firmed the expreiTions that her beauty made, and 
 
 * I am now all her's.' 
 
 . As Sir Bazil had never difcovered any thing in 
 Mr. Truev/orth's behaviour, that could give him 
 the lead caufe to fufped what now he was fo fully 
 informed of by his own confeflion, he was very 
 much aftonifhed, ' Is it pofllble !' cried he, _' are 
 
 * you in earneft, and do you really love Harriot ?' 
 <- * Yes, from my foul I do,' replied Mr. True- 
 worth, * and wifh no other bleffing this fide hea- 
 
 * yen than to obtain her : as to the fix thoufand 
 
 * pound you fpeak of, I neither fhould demand, nor 
 
 * would accept it, 'till well aflured the payment of 
 
 * it was quite agreeable to tlie fituation of your af- 
 
 * fairs.' 
 
 ' Would you then marry Harriot with nothing,' 
 faid Sir Bazil, * or what is tantamount to nothing, 
 
 * a fmall fortune, and that to be paid difcretion- 
 
 * ary, rather than Mrs. Blanchfield with trv'enty 
 
 * thoufand pounds in ready fpecier' — Not only ra- 
 
 * ther than Mrs. Blanchfield,' replied Mr. True- 
 worth, * but than any other woman in the 
 
 * world, with all thofe thoufands multiplied into 
 / millions.' 
 
 ' Amazing love and generofity !' cried Sir Bazil 
 with fome vehemence; ---* could flie be capable of 
 
 * refufing, (he were unworthy of you j—but this 
 
 * you may be aflured of, that if all the influence { 
 
 * have over her can engage her to be yours, flie 
 
 * (hall be fo.'--- Mr. Trueworth could teftify the 
 tranfport this promife gave him no otb.erwife than 
 by a warm embrace, faying, at the fame time, 
 
 * Dear, Sir Bazil i ---' Yes,' rejoined that gentle - 
 maT2, ' to give my fifter fuch a hulband as Mr.

 Here enfued a little conteft between them ; 
 
 • Sir Bazil was afhamed to accept ' that 
 
 proof of friendihip Mr. Truewortli profFered, 
 but the many arguments he made ufe of, joined 
 to tliC confideration of his own eafe, at laft pre- 
 vailed ; after which Sir Bazil told him, the ladies 
 ■were gone to the (hops, in order to make fome 
 purchaies they wanted, but that he would take 
 the firft opportunity on their return, to ac- 
 quaint his fifter with the fentiments he had fur 
 her, and appointed to meet him at the chocolatc- 
 houfe in the evening, to let him know the iac*

 'Shews the different operations of the fame faffion^ 
 in perfons of different principles and difpoji^ 
 tions. 
 
 SI R Bazil had very much at heart the accom- 
 plifhmcnt of the promife he had made to 
 Mr. Trueworth, and indeed no one thing could 
 have Teemed more Urange than that of his being 
 otherwife, when fo many reafons concurred to en- 
 gage his integrity : he had a real friendftiip 
 
 for the perfon, who defired his ailiftance, there 
 was none among all bis acquaintance for whom 
 he had a greater regard, or who fhared more of 
 
 his good wiflies ; the natural affeclion he 
 
 had for his fifler made him rtjoicc in the oppor- 
 tunity of feeing her fo happily difpofcd of, and 
 the partLcukr interefl of his own paffion, might well 
 render him not only fincere, but alfo zealous in prr- 
 moting an affair, which would fo fully ' anfwer all 
 thefe ends. 
 
 The firft breaking the matter to Mifs Harriot 
 he looked upon as the greatcft difficulty j for he 
 doubted not but when once a belief of Mr. True- 
 worth's inclinations was properly inculcated in her, 
 his amiable perfon, and fine qualities, would enable 
 him to make his way, as a lover, into a heart, 
 which had already a high eftcem for him as an ac- 
 quaintance. 
 
 He refolved, however, not to delay making the 
 difcovery, and his fifters coming honae foon after, 
 he ran out of his drefling-room, and met them as 
 they were going up flairs into their own chamber, 
 with a whole cargo of filks, and other things they 
 
 had been buying : ' Hold, hold,' cried he. 
 
 Dot fuffering them to pafs, ' pray come in here, 
 ' and let me fee what bargains you have been

 ' making ?* — « What underftanding can 
 ' you, that are a batchelor, have in thefe 
 
 ' things ? ' faid A4rs. Wellair, laughing. 
 
 ' I have the more need then of being inform- 
 ' ed/ replied he, * that I may be the better a-- 
 ' ble to judge both of the fancy and frugality 
 
 * of my v.ife, whenever I am fo happy to get 
 
 * one.' 
 
 ' Well, we!!, I know all you men muft be 
 
 * humoured,' faid Mrs. Wellair, in the fame 
 gay ftrain : * come, filler, let us un- 
 
 * pack our bundles.' With thefe words they 
 
 both went in, and the fervant who followed themi 
 with the things, having laid them down on a table, 
 withdrew. 
 
 The ladies then began to open their parcels, and 
 Sir Bazil gave his opinion firft of one thing, and 
 then of another, as they were (hewn to him, 'till 
 Mifs Harriot difplaying a roll of very rich white da- 
 niafk, * to which of you does this belong?' faid Sir 
 Bazil.—-' To me,' anfwered (he.-—' Hah ! — I 
 ' am glad on it, upon my foul,' rejoined he : ' this 
 
 * is an omen of marriage, my dear fifter :---! will 
 ^ lay my life upon it, that you become a bride in 
 
 * this gown.'—-' I muft firft find the man to make 
 
 * me lb, cried (he brifkly.-— ' He is not very far to 
 ' feek, I dare anfwer,' faid Sir Bazil. — * Why 
 
 * then,' replied (he, * when he is found he muft 
 
 * wait till my mind comes to me, and that I be- 
 
 * lieve, will not be in the wearing of this gown.' 
 
 * I am of a different way of thinking,' faid he, 
 fomevvhat more gravely than before ;--' v.- hat would 
 
 * you fay if I (hould tell you, that one of the fineft,. 
 
 * moft accoinplilhed men in Europe is fallen de- 
 ' fperately in love with you, and has engaged me to 
 
 * he his interceffor ?'— -* I (hould fay nothing,' an- 
 fwered (l)e, ' but that you have a mind to divert 
 
 * yourfcjfj and put me out of humour with my

 * new gowiT, by your converting it into a hiero- 
 
 * g'yphic.-- I-^ i'peaking tliefe words fhe catched up 
 her Alk, aiid ran haftily up flairs, leaving Mrs. 
 Wellair and her brother together. 
 
 ' Poor f .rriot,' faid Sir Bazil, after flie was 
 gone, ' I have put her to the blufti Vviih the very 
 ' name of matrimony ; — ^but I alTure you, fifter,' 
 continued he to Mrs. Wellair, * the thing I have 
 
 * mentioned is ferious.'— — * Indeed !' cried that 
 
 Jady in fome furprife. ' Yes, upon my honour,' 
 
 refumed he, ' the gentleman I mean had not left 
 
 * me above a quarter of an hour before you came 
 ' in, and I can tell you is one whom you know.' 
 
 * — If I know him,' replied (he, af:er a paufe, * I 
 
 * fancy I need not be at any lofs to guefs his name, 
 ,*. by the defcription you have given rne of him j 
 ,* for I have feen no man fince my coming to town, 
 
 * who fo well deferves thofe encomiums as Mr. 
 
 * Trueworth.' — ' I am glad you t,hink fo,' iaJd 
 Sir Bazil i ' for I am certain your judgment will 
 
 * go a great way with Harriot > be is, in fa£^, 
 
 ' the perfon I have been fpeaking of, and is fo eve- 
 
 * ry way deferving of my filler's afFe^lion, that fhe 
 
 * muft not only be the mofl infenfible creature in 
 ' the Vv'orld, but alfo the grcateft enemy to her own 
 
 * interefl: and happinefs, to refufe him.' 
 
 He then repeated to her all the converfation he 
 had that morning with Mr. Trueworth, the anfwers 
 that gentleman had given him to the propofition he 
 
 had made on Mrs. Blanchfield's account ; his 
 
 declaration of his paflion for Mifs Harriot, and every 
 other particular, excepting that of the non-payment 
 of her fortune ; and that he concealed only becaufe 
 he would not be fufpe<3ed to have been bribed by 
 it, to fay more of his friend than he really merited. 
 
 Mrs. Wellair was equally charmed and aflonifhed 
 at this report, and on Sir Bazil's telling her, that 
 Mr. Trueworth was under fome apprehenftons, 
 
 that 
 

<#PG# 54>
46 r/-^ H I S T O R Y of 
 
 that the pleafure fhe took in having her fifter with 
 her, would be an impediment to his defires, {he 
 very gravely replied, that {he was very forry Mr. 
 Trucworth {hould imagine, {lie was fo wanting in 
 underflanding, or true aifc6lion to her fifter, as for 
 the felf-fatisfadtion of her company, to offer any 
 thing in oppofition to her intereft or i^ppinefs. 
 
 After this they had a good deal of difcourfe toge- 
 ther, concerning Mr. Tiueworth's family and for- 
 tune, the particulars of both which Sir Bazd v/as 
 very well acquainted with, and Mrs. Wellair being 
 thoroughly convinced by what he faid of the many 
 advantages of the alliance propofed, afiured him, in 
 the flrongeft terms {he was able, that {he would do 
 every thing in her power to promote it. 
 
 ' I'll entertain her on this fubje6l v.'hile we are 
 
 * dreffing,' faid {he ; ' your pleafantry on the 
 
 * white damafl-i will furnifh me w'th an excellent 
 
 * pretence ; ^^I fl-sall begin in the fame {Irain ycu

 * I know,' faid Sir Bazil, ' that you women are

 * I fee you are hearty in the cauf , fhall wholly de- 
 
 * pend or! your management ; — but hearkye, fifler,' 
 continued he, perceiving {lie v/as going out of the

 ' mife I have made him ; now you know we 
 
 ' (hall have a great deal of company at dinner to

 ' ing to yoru in private before the time uf my going 
 
 ' to him ; for thai reafon we muft have Tome 
 
 ' watch word between us, that may give an inti- 
 ' mation in general, how Harriot receives what you 
 ' have faid to her. 
 
 ' Oh, that is cafy,' cried Mrs. Wellair, as thus, 
 ' ■) ou Ihail take an occafion, either at table, 
 
 * or any time when you find it mofi proper, to 
 
 * aftc me, how I do ? and by my anfwer to that 
 
 * queftion, you will be able to judge what fuccefs 
 ' 1 have had.' * \tiy right,' replied SirBazil, 
 
 * and I will be fure to obferve.'. — There pafl'ed no 
 more between them, fhe went diredly up Hairs to 
 do as flie had faid, and Sir Bazil to pay his moining 
 viiit to Mifs Mabel, as he ufually did every day. 
 
 7"hc humours of thefe two worthy perf jns, were 
 extremely weil adapted to make each other hap- 
 py :---Sir Bazil W23 gay, but he was perfedlly fin- 
 cere ;— Mifs Mabel had a great deal of foftnefs in 
 her nature, bjt it was entirely under the direction 
 of her prudence 3---fhe returned the pafHon of her 
 lover with equal tendernefs, yet would not permit 
 the gratification of it, *till every thing that threaten- 
 ed an interruption of their mutual eafe fliould be 
 removed."- Sir Bazil made no fecret of his affairs 
 to her J —file knew very well, that he defu^d no 
 more at prefent of her father than the fix th^jfand 
 pounds, charged on his eftate for Mifs Harriot's 
 fortune, and as the old gentleman teflified the 
 liigheil: efteem fur him, and fatisfadion in the pro- 
 pofed match, {he flattered htrfelf, that he would at 
 iafl: confcnt to fo reafonable a requefl, but, till 
 he did (^o, remained firm in her refolution of deny- 
 ing botli her own, and lover's wiihes. 
 
 The 
 

<#PG# 56>
48 The Hist OR Y of 
 
 Ttie pleafure with which they always faw each' 
 other, was now however greatly enhanced by his 
 acquainting her with the almoft afTured^hope he had, 
 that the difficulty, wi)ich had fo long kept them' 
 afunder, would be foon got over, and he fhould 
 have the inexpreffible fatisfadion of complying with 
 the conditions her father had propofed, without the 
 leaft danger of incurring any inconvenience to him- 
 felf. 
 
 The clock ftriking two, he was obliged to leave 
 her, and go home to receive the company he ex- 
 pe6led ;-— he behaved among his friends with his 
 accuftomed vivacity, but calling his eyes frequently 
 towards Mifs Harriot, he imagined he faw a certain 
 gloom upon her countenance, which made him 
 fearful for the eiFedtof Mrs. Wellair's follicitations, 
 till reconciling the agreement between him and 
 that lady, he cried out haftily to her, ' How do 
 ' you do, filler ?' To which £he anfwered, with a 
 fmile, * As well as can be expected, brother j' 
 -—and then to prevent Mifs Harriot, or any one 
 elfe from wondering what fhe meant byfo odd a re- 
 ply, added^ ' after the ugly jolt I have had this 
 
 * morning over London flunes in a hackney 
 ' coach.' 
 
 " Sir Bazil eafily underftood, that by the v/ords, 
 
 • As well as can be expected,' his fifler meaned as 
 much as could be hoped for, from the firft attack 
 6n a maid fo young and innocent, as Mifs Harriot, 
 and doubted not but that fo favourable a beginning 
 would have as fortunate a conclufion. 
 
 Thofe guefts who had dined with him- ftayed 
 flipper alfo, but that did not hinder him from ful- 
 filling his engagement with Mr. Trueworth ; 
 
 he begged they would excufe a fhort excurfion, 
 which he faid he was obliged to make, on extraor- 
 dinary buftnefs, and accordingly went at the time 
 appointed for the meeting that gentleman.

 Mr. Trueworth received the intelligence he

 ' apprehend, fince Mrs, Wellair vouch (afed to he- 
 
 i come his advocate. ' It is certainly,' faid fir 
 
 Bazil, ' greatly in her power to forward the com- 
 
 * pletion of your wifhes, as it was to have ob- 
 
 * flru6led them ; bur, my dear friend,' conti- 
 nued he, * there is no titiie to be loft : — the bufi-

 * ot's behaviour, on her firft hearing an account 
 
 * of the affection with which you honour her, and 
 
 * by that you may the better judge how to proceed. 
 This v/as the i'ubftance of all the dilcourfe they 
 had together at that time j«— fir Bazil went home, 
 and Mr. Trueworth adjourned to a cofTce-houfe, 
 where he met with fomething not very pleafing 
 to him.—— It was a letter from Mifs Flora, con- 
 taining thefe lines : 
 
 To Charles Ttueworth, Efa; 
 
 ' I\Iy dear 'Tmeivorth,

 ' done to forfeit it ? — But fure you cannot think 
 
 * of abandoning me !— of leaving me to all the 
 ' horrors of defpair and /hame ! — « No, 'tis 
 
 * impoffiWe,.— ingratitude confifts not with that 
 
 * flri6l honour you pretend to, and that I ftill flat- 
 
 * ter myfelf you are in reality poflefled of ; . 
 
 * you may have had fome bufinefsj — but how 
 
 * poor a thing is bufinefs when compared with 
 Move! And I may reply with our Englifh Sap^ 
 ' pho, in one of her amorous epiftles, 
 
 * Bufinefs you feign, but did you love like me^ 
 
 * I Should your moll: important bufinefs be.' 
 
 * But whither does my hurrying fpirits tranf- 
 Vport me ?-— ' If I am flill fo happy to retain 
 
 * any fliare of your heart, I have faid too much j 
 ' if I am not, all I can fay will be inefFe6lual to 
 ' move you. — I fhall therefore only tell you, that 
 ' I can live no longer without feeing you, and 
 ' will call on you at the cofTee^houfe this evening 
 '.about eight, till when I am, 
 
 ' Though in the utmofl: diftraflion, 
 ' My dear, dear Trueworth,

 ' F. Mel LAS IN.' 
 
 * P. S. Having heard you fay letters were left for

 * once or twice every day, I thought it more 
 ' proper to direct for you here, than at your

 * fail to meet me at the hour.' 
 
 Scarce could the ghofl of a forlkken miflrefs, 
 .draw'ing his curtains at the dead of nighr, have 
 ihccked Mr. Trueworth more than this epiftle; 
 
 he had indeed done no more than any man, 
 
 ,of his age ind conftitution would have done, if 
 lempted ir. the manner he had been, yet he re- 
 proached 
 

<#PG# 59>
Mifs Betsy Thoughtl&ss. 5:1' 
 
 proached himfelf fevcrely for it: — he knew 
 how little this unhappy creature had her paflions 
 in fiibjecSion, and though all the liking he ever 
 had for her was now fwallowed up in his honour- 
 able affedions for Mils Harriot, yet he was too 
 humane and too generous not to pity the extrava- 
 gance of a fljme he was no long«r capable of re- 
 turning ; — he wanted her to know there was a 
 neceflity for their parting, but knew not how to 
 do it without driving her to extremes : — he 
 hated all kind of diflimulation, and as neither his 
 honour, nor his inclination, would permit him to 
 continue an amorous correfpondence with her^ 
 he was very much at a lofs how to put an end to 
 it, without letting her into the real caule, which 
 as yet he thought highly improper to do. 
 
 It coll him Ibme time in debating within him- 
 felf how he fliould behave^ in an affair which was. 
 indeed, in the prefent fituation of his heart, pretty 
 perplexing j— he confidered mifs Flora as a woman 
 of condition, — as one who tenderly loved him, 
 and as one, who on both the fe accounts, it would 
 not become him to affront j — he refledried alfb, 
 that a woman who had broke through all the rule* 
 of virtue, modefty, and even common decency for 
 the gratification of her wild defiVes, might, when 
 denied that gratification, be capable of taking fuch 
 fteps as might not only expofe her own chara<Ser» 
 but with it fo much of his, as might ruin him 
 with Mifs Harriot ; —he found it therefore highly 
 neceffary to difguife his fentiments, and afi to- 
 wards her in fuch a manner as fliould wean her 
 affeflions from him by degrees, without his feem- 
 ing to intend, or wilh for fuch an event. 
 
 He had but jnft come to this determination 
 
 when he was told from the bar, th-it a Isdy in a 
 
 hackney coach defired to Ipeak with him j — he 
 
 vVfnt directly to her, but inftead of ordering the 
 
 F 2. man 
 

<#PG# 60>
5^ The H I S T O R Y rf 
 
 man to drive to any particular houfe, bid him 
 drive as flowly as he could round St. James's 
 fquare. 
 
 This very much ftartling her, fhe allied him 
 what he meaned ? — ' Are all the houfes of enter- 
 ' tainment in the town,' faid flie, * fliiit up, that 
 ' we muft talk to one another in the ftreet ?' — It 
 
 * IS impoffible for me, madam,' anfwered he, ' to 
 ' have the pleafure of your company this evening, 
 ' — ! am engaged with fome gentlemen at the 
 
 * houle where you found me, and have given my 
 
 * promife to return in ten minutes.'— Thefe 
 words, and the referved tone in which he fpoke 
 them, ftabbed her to the heart, - ■ ' Ungene- 
 ' rous man !' cried ihe, ' is it thus you repay 
 ' the moft tender and ardent paflion that ever 
 ' was ?' — * You ladies,' faid he, ' when once you 
 ' give way to the foft impulie, are apt to devote 
 ' yourlelves too much to it j but men have a thou- 
 ' fand other amufements, which all claim a fhare 
 ' in the variegated fcenes of life j — I am forry, 
 
 * therefore, to find you difquieted in the manner 
 
 * your letter intimates.— Love fhould be nurfed 
 ' by laughing, eafe, and joy j lour difcontent, re- 
 
 * proaches, and complaints, deform its native 
 
 * beauty, and render that a curfe, which otherwife 
 
 * would be the greatell: of our bleflings. — • I beg 
 
 * you, therefore,' continued he, with fomewhat 
 more foftnefs in his voice, ' for your own fake, to 
 
 * moderate this vehemence; — be affiired I will 
 
 * fee you as often as poffible, and fliall always 
 
 * think of vou with the regard I ought to do.' 
 
 Perceiving fhe was in very great agonies, he 
 threw his arms about her waifte, and gave her a 
 very affectionate lalute, which, though no more 
 than what a brother might have offered to a fifter, 
 a little mitigated the force of her grief: — ' I fee 
 
 * I am undone,' cried /he 3 — ' I have lofl your 
 
 * heart,

 * heart, and am the mofl: wretched creature upon 
 
 * earth 1'——' Do not fay fo,' replied he ;- 
 
 * I never can be ungrateful for the favours you 
 
 * have beftowed upon me j butdifcretion ought to 
 
 * be obferved in an amour fuch as our's : — I 
 
 * have really fome affairs upon my hands, which 
 
 * for a time will very much engrols me, — make

 * renders you fo agreeable to the world, and de- 
 
 * pend upon it, that to make me happy you muft 
 ' be fo your fe If*. ■* When then ihall I fee 
 
 * you,' cried fhe, ftill weeping and hanging on 
 his breaft ? ' As foon as convenience permits I 
 ' will fend to you,' faid he,' ' but there is a necef- 
 ' fity for my leaving you at prefent.' 
 
 He then called to the coachman to drive back 
 to the houfe where he had takeahim up. ——It 
 is not to be doubted but fhe made ufe of all the 
 rhetoric of defperate dying love, and every other 
 art fhe was miftrefs o^ to engage him to prefix, 
 fome time for their meeting ; but he would not 
 fuffer himfelf to be prevailed upon fo far, and he 
 left her with no other confblation than a fecond 
 embrace, little warmer than the former had been, 
 and a repetition of the promife he had made of 
 writing to her in a fhort time..

 WHAT pain foever the good nature and ge- 
 nerofity of Mr. Trueworth had made him 
 fuffer, at fight of the unfortunate Mifs Flora's 
 dilireis, it was diffipated by recalling to his mind 
 the pleaiing idea fir Bazil had infpiredin him, of 
 F 3 fucceeding

 Succeeding in his vvi/hes with the amiable Mifs, 
 Harriot. 
 
 What lleep he had that night, doubtlefs, pre- 
 fented him with nothing but the delightful ima- 
 ges of approaching joys, and, poflibly, might 
 give him fome intimation of what was in thofe 
 moments doing for him, by thofc who were 
 waking for hisintereft. 
 
 Mrs. Wellair, who was extremely cauMous how 
 ihe undertook any thing, without being fully con- 
 vinced it was right, and no lefs induftrious in ac- 
 eomplifhing whatever fhe had once undertook, 
 had employed all the time fhe had, with her 
 fifter before dinner, in reprefenting to her, in the 
 moft pathetic terms, the paffion Mr. Trueworth 
 had for her, — the extraordinary merits he was 
 pofTefled of, and the many advantages of an alli- 
 ance with him j but Mifs Harriot was modeft to 
 that excels,^ that to be told, though from the 
 mouth of a fifter, /he had infpired any inclinati- 
 ons of the fort fhe mentioned, gave her the ut- 
 mofl: confufion 5 — fhe had not confidered the 
 ditFerences of fcxes, and could not hear that any 
 tiling in her had reminded others of it, without 
 Mufhing : — the effefis of her beauty gave her 
 rather a painful than a pleafing fenlation, and fhe 
 was r^ady to die with fhame at what the moft part 
 f'F women are fludious to acquire, and look on as 
 5 heir greateft glory. 
 
 She offered nothing, however, in oppofirion to 
 Ti.hat Mrs. Wellair had faid, concerning the per- 
 if>n, or amiable qualities of Mr. Trueworth 5 
 neither indeed had fhe a will to do it , — — fhe 
 bad been always highly pleafed with his conver-' 
 fnivin, and had treated him with the fame inno- 
 cent freedom fhe did her brother, and fhe was 
 now afraid, that it was her behaving to him in 
 ihis manner, that had encouraged him to think of

 I favour file had fhewn him, left he fhould have^ 
 
 conrtrued them into a meaning, which was far 
 
 diftant from. her thoughts ; and thefe reflections 
 
 I it was, that occafioned that unufual penfivene fs,, 
 
 which fir Bazil had obferved in her st dinner, 
 
 and which had given him fome apprehenfions 
 
 proceeded from a caufe. lefs favourable to his 
 
 friend. 
 
 Mrs. Wellair was not at all difcouraged by the* 
 
 ; manner in which her fifter had liftened to this 
 
 ' overture 5 — (he knew that feveral propofals of 
 
 the fam& nature had been made to her in the 
 
 country, all which Ihe had rejected, and rejected. 
 
 with a difdain : a certain air of abhorrence 
 
 widely diflftrent to what ihe teftified on accounti 
 of Mr. Trueworth ; and this prudent lady rightly 
 ■ judged, that he had little elfe to combat with, 
 than the over-ba^hfulnefs of his miftrefs. 
 
 At night, on going to bed^ fhe renewed the 
 difcourfe, and purfued the theme fhe had began, 
 with fuch fuccefs, that fhe ; brought Mifs Harriot 
 to confei^, fhe believed there was no man more- 
 deferving to be loved than Mr. Trueworth ; — — 
 
 * but my dear fifter,' faid fhe, ' I have no incli- 
 
 * nation to marry, nor to leave you 5 I am quite 
 ' * happy as I am, and defire to be no more fo :' to 
 
 which the other repHed, that was childifh talking, 
 — hat fhe would, doubtlefs, marry fome time or 
 other, — that (he might, perhaps, never have fo 
 good an offer, and could not pofTibly have a bet- 
 ter, therefore advifed her, not to flip the prefent 
 opportunity, but whenever Mr. Trueworth fhould 
 make a declaration of his paflion to herfelf, tp re- 
 ceive it in luch a manner, as Ihoiild not give him 
 any room to imagine flie was utterly averfe to bis 
 pretenfions.

56 1'he HISTORY of 
 
 Mifs Harriot fufFered her to urge her on tht|, 
 point for a conilderable time, but at laft replied, 
 in a low and hefirating voice, that fhe would be 
 guided by her friends, who fhe was perfeftly 
 convinced had her intereit at heart, and knew 
 ,much better than herfelf what condu^ fhe ought 
 to obferve : to which Mrs. Wellair replied, that , 
 /he doubted not but the end would abundantly ; > 
 juftify the advice had been given her. 
 
 The firft thing this lady did in the morning, 
 was to go to her brother's chamber, and acquaint 
 him with all that had paflfed between herlielf and 
 Mils Harriot} after wliich they agreed together, 
 that Mr. Trueworth fhould have an opportunity 
 that very day of making his addreffes to her. 
 
 Though Sir Bazil thought it needlefs to add 
 any thing to what was already done, yet he could 
 not forbear taking n occafion, when they were at 
 breakfafl, to mention Mr. Trueworth's name, and 
 the many good qualities he was poflefled of.*— Mrs. 
 "Wellair joined in the prailes her brother gave him, ^ 
 but Mils Harriot fpoke not a word : — on which, \ 
 
 * Are you not of our opinion, lifter ?' cried he to 
 her. I ■ ' Yes,' brother, anfwere;! ihe, 'Mr. 
 ' Trueworth is certainly a very fine gentleman.'— 
 
 * How cold is fuch an expreffion,' refumed fir Ba- 
 zil, 'and even that extorted ?'——' You would 
 ' not fure, fir,' faid flie, a little gaily, ' have me 
 
 * in raptures about him, and fpeak as if I were in 
 
 * love with him V 
 
 ' Indeed but I would,* cried fir Bazil }' * and, 
 
 * what is more, would alio have you be fo 3 — he 
 
 * deierves it from you, and as you muft fome rime 
 
 * or other be fenlible of the tender paiTion, you -i 
 
 * cannot do it at more iuitable years.' — - ' I Tee no |

 * It is a fign then,' faid he, * that you have not

 ' * if you have not, I will repeat it to you. 
 
 * In vain from fate we ftrive to fly, 
 
 * For firft or laft, as all mull die, 
 
 * So 'tis decreed by thofe above, 
 
 * That firft or laft, we all muft love.' 
 
 * Poets are not always prophets', anfwered fh.e, 
 ' laughing.— —' It depends upon Mr, Trueworth 
 " himfelf,' faid fir Bazil, ' to prevent you from 
 '* giving the lie to the predi6lion 5 — if he fails, I 
 ' * ihall believe no other man in the world will e-

 I cried Ihe 5 ' but I fhall etideavour to behave fo

 ' * be far from making good your oracle. 
 
 A gentleman coming in to fir Bazil, broke off 
 
 [their difcourfe, and relieved Mils Harriot from 
 
 any farther perfecution at this time,— It was not 
 
 that flie difliked either the perfon or converfati- 
 
 on of Mr, Trueworth, or that Ihe was tired wirh 
 
 tthe praifes given him by her brother and fifter 5— 
 
 (on the contrary, Pnt found a thoufand things, 
 
 (which they had not mentioned, to admire in him : 
 
 •—in fine, he was, in reality, lefs indifferent to 
 
 (her, than (he herlelf imagined 5 but there was a 
 
 (Certain fhynefs in her difpofition, which mingled 
 
 Home fhar^-of pain with the pleafure of hearing 
 
 Ihim fpoke of as her lover. 
 
 She was fenfible this propenfity, which nature 
 had implanted, was a weaknefs in her j but though 
 /lie ufed her utmoft efforts for overcoming it,

5f The HISTORY of 
 
 ftie found herfelf unequal to the taft : — in vaia 
 /he confidered, that the addrefles of a man of 
 fuch perfeft honour and politenefs, as Mr. True- 
 worth, could not but be accompanied with the 
 moft profouad refpeit: — in vain fhe called to 
 mind the example of other ladies, whom fhe had 
 feen behave in the company of thofe, who pro- 
 fefled themfelves their lovers, wirh the greateft 
 eafeand Iprightlineft, the very iight of Mr. True- 
 worth, ^ fhe faw him from her chamber window, 
 talking ^ith her brother in the garden, threw her- 
 heart into palpitations, which all the reafon /he" 
 was miftrefs of, could not enable her to quiet;- 
 but when obliged to go down and fit with him a^ 
 table, her confufion increafed, by being more- 
 near the objeft which occafioned it ; — /he en~ 
 deavoured to treat him with the fame freedom 
 /he had been accuftomed, but it was not in her* 
 power : — in fine, never woman fuffered more, 
 in conftraining herfelf to be filent and demure,, 
 than fhe did, in conftraining herfelf to be talka-' 
 live and gay. 
 
 What then became of her, when fir Bazil and' 
 Mrs. Wellair, after making a formal excufe for z, 
 /hort abfence, went out, and left her expofed to, 
 the follicitations of a paffion, which her^ timid: 
 raodefty had made her fo much dread ? 
 
 The moment Mr. Trueworth law himfelf alone- 
 with her, he approached her with the moft tenn, 
 d.er and refperaul air, * How often, madam, 
 
 * have f languifhed for an opportunity, fuch as. 
 
 * this, of telling you how much my foul adores 
 
 * you ! ~ My dear friend, fir Bazil, has aflfured 
 
 * me he has prepared you to torgive the boldnefs 
 
 * of my flame, and that for his fake you will, 
 
 * vouchfafe to liflen to my vows; but it is from 
 
 * mvfelf alone you can be convinced, of the afr 
 ' dency. of the love you have infpired.' 
 
 * My 
 

<#PG# 67>
Mifs Be-tsy Thoughtlebs. 5^ 
 
 * My brother, fir,' anfwered fhe, blufhing, 
 
 * has indeed informed me, that I have obligations 
 
 * to you of a nature, which I was as far from ex- 
 ' peeing, as I am from deferving.*-*— Here Mr. 
 Trueworth began to run into fbme praifes on the 
 charms which had fubdued his heart, which, 
 though no more than dilated by his real (enri- 
 ments, ifeemed to her too extravagant, and be- 
 yond what her modefty would fuffer her to en- 
 dure : * Hold, fir' cried /he, interrupting him, 
 
 '* if you would have me believe your profeffions 
 " are fincere, forbear, J befeech you, to talk to me 
 '■* in this manner : — ' it is an ill-judged policy, 
 
 * methinks, in yau men, to idolize the women too 
 ' much, you wifh would think well of you j— • 
 
 * if our lex are in reality fo vain as you generally 
 
 * reprefent us, on whom but yourlelves can the 
 
 * fault be laid ?-— And if we prove fo weak as 
 
 * to imagine-aurfelves fuch, as either the flattery, 
 
 * or the partial affetSion of the lover paints us, we 
 
 * fliall be apt to take every thing as our due, and 
 
 * think little gratitude is owing, for the offering 
 
 * he makes us of his heart.' 
 
 Mr, Trueworth was perfeflly ravifhed at hear- 
 ing her fpeak thus, but durft nor exprefs himfelf 
 'with too much warmth on the occafion : »— - * It 
 
 * mail be confefled, madam,' replied he, ' that 
 
 * the beauties of the perfon, v/hen not accompanie-d 
 
 * by thofe of the mind, afford but a fhort lived

 * captivated heart regains its former liberty, •■ - 
 ' nay, perhaps, wonders at itfelf for having been 
 ' enilaved : — whereas thofe darts, which fly from

 * in the lovely Harriot/ continued he, talcing one 
 of her hands and kiffing itj— — * When in the 
 
 * moil enchanting fortn that nature ever made, is 
 
 * found a foul enriched with every virtue,— — 
 ' every grace, -* how indiflbluble is the chain ! 
 ,' — how glorious the bondage !' 
 
 * Love IS a theme I have never made my ftudy,' 
 anfwered fhe ; ' but according to my notions of 
 
 * the matter, thofe gentlemen, who pretend to be 
 
 * affected by it, give themfelvesmore trouble than 
 'they need, — as that paflion is generally al- 
 ' Jow'd rather to be the child of fancy, than of 
 ' real merit in the^obje£l loved, I Ihould think it 
 
 * would be fufficient for any man in his addreffes 
 
 * to a lady, to tell her, that fhe happens to hit hiis 
 
 * tafte, — that /he is what he likes, without dref^ 
 
 * fing her up in qualities, which, perhaps, have no 
 
 * exilience but in his own imagination.' 
 
 * Where love is founded on beauty alone, as I 
 
 * have already faid,' refumed Mr. Trueworth, 
 
 * the inftruftions you give, madam, of the man- 
 
 * ner of declaring it, is certainly very jufl: ^ for, in- 
 
 * deed, no farther could be warranted by fincerity : 
 
 * —but where reafon directs the lover's choice, 
 
 * and points out thofe excellencies which alone 
 
 * can make him happy in the pofTeflion of his 
 
 * wifhes, ideas more fublime will naturally arife, 
 
 * and we can never too much admire, or praife, 
 
 * what is immediately from the Divine Source of 
 
 * all perfeflion ! — It is not, O charming Harriot !' 
 purfued he, looking on her with the utmoft ten- 
 dernels^— 'it is not thofe radiant eyes, — that 
 '• lovely mouth, nor that fweet majefly, that fliines 
 'through all your air, but it is the heaven within 
 
 * thai I adore • — ro that I pay my prefent wurfhip, 
 ' and on that build all my hopes of future blifs.' 
 
 Mifs Harriot was about to m;:ke fonie reply, 
 but his looks, the vehemence with which he ut- 
 tered 
 

<#PG# 69>

 tcred thele lail words, and the paffionare cjefture 
 which accompanied them> made her relaple into 
 her former bafhfulnels, from which Ihe had a 
 little recovered herfelf, and again deprived her 
 of the power of fpeech. 
 
 * Yon give up the point then my angel,* cried 
 he perceiving fhe was filent, * and I am glad 
 
 * yoii do 5 for had you continued to prohibit ray 
 
 * expatiating on thefe merits, which made me 
 
 * your adorer, I muft have maintained the argu- 
 
 * ment even againft your lovely lelf, to whom 
 
 * \ (hall for ever vield in all things elfe.' 
 
 After thii he fell, infenflbly as it were, into 
 fome difcourfe concerning the divine ordinance of 
 marriage, and then proceeded to give her the mofl 
 •amiable pi<5ltire, that words could form of that 
 'ftate, when two perfons of virtue, honour, and 
 good fenfe, were by love and law united, and 
 'lb I nd themfelves equally bound by duty and in- 
 clination, to make each other's happinefs. 
 fc There are fome ladies, who liilen very con- 
 tentedly to the moft warm and amorous addrefles 
 -can be made to them, yet will not luflTer the leall

 WHILE Mr.Trueworth was thus profecuting 
 a fuit, which every time he faw the lovely 
 Harriot redoubled his impatience to accomplifh; 
 Mr. Francis Thoughtlefs had been twice at his 
 lodgings without finding him at home ; but pn 
 that gentleman's leaving his name the fecond 
 time, and faying, he would come again the next 
 morning, the other thought himfelf underan in- 
 difpenfible neceffity of flaying to receive his vifit. 
 The meeting of thefe two was extremely civil 
 and polite, but far from that cordial familiarity 
 which ufed to pafs between them, efpecially on 
 the fide of Mr. Francis. — After Mr. Trueworth 
 had congratulated him on the recovery of his 
 health, and coming to town, they fell into ibme 
 difcourfe on ordinary affairs, without the leafl 
 mention of Mifs Betly, by either party, for a con- 
 fiderable time, till her brother growing a little 
 impatient, that the other /hould fay nothing to 
 him on an aflfair, in which he had made him his 
 confidant, and which he had taken fo much pains 
 to forward, faid to him, with an air partly gay, 
 and partly f'erious, — ' I was furprifed on my ar- 
 
 * rival to be told, that a paflion fo violent, as that 
 
 * you pretended for my fifler, fhould all on a lud- 
 
 * den vanifh, and that a thing, which I once 
 
 * thought fb near being concluded, was entirely 
 
 * broken cff.' 
 
 ' Things of that nature,' replied Mr.Trueworth 
 
 coldly, * are never concluded till accomplifhed : 
 
 *«—- accidents ibmetimes intervene to feparate

 * perfons,who have feemed moft likely to be united 
 
 * for ever, which, indeed, never was the cafe be- 
 
 * tween me and that lady.* 
 
 ' Yet, fir,' rejoined the other, a little irritated 
 at his manner of fpeaking, ' I think, that when a 
 ' gentleman has made his addrefles to a young lady 
 
 * of family and charat^ler, for any length of time, 
 
 * and in the public manner you did, Ibme caufe 
 
 * ought to be affigned for his deferting her.' 
 
 * I am under no obligation,' laid Mr. True worth, 
 very gloomily, * to give an account of my beha- 
 
 * viour to any on;e whatever j but in confideration 
 ' of our friend fhip, and the love I once had for 
 
 * your iifter, I Ihall make no fcruple to tell you, 
 
 * that a woman of her humour would fuit but ill 
 ' with a n>an of mine 5 — — as to any farther ecclair- 
 
 * cifement of this affair, it is from herfelf alone 
 'you muft receive it.'- ■ * She fh«wed me 3 
 
 * letter from you, fir,' cried Mr. Francis hailily.— 
 VThat might then fuffice to inform you,' anfwer- 
 
 * ed Mr. Trueworth, that in what I have done, I 
 
 * but obeyed the dictates of my honour,' — — ' Ho- 
 
 * nour !' cried the other, fiercely, and laying his 
 
 * hand upon his fword, ' What is it you mean, fir ? 
 
 * Did honour oppole your marriage with my fifter ?' 
 -' * No menaces,' laid Mr. Trueworth, with a gra- 
 vity which was pretiy near difdain, — ' you know 
 
 * me incapable of fear ;— I have fought for your 
 
 * fifter, but will never fight againft her. — I in- 
 *jure not her reputation ;—— on the contrary, I 
 
 * would defend it if unjulUy attacked, even at the 
 
 * hazard of my life j but as to love or marriage, 
 ' thefe are things now out of the queftion, — we 
 
 * both, perhaps, have other views, and the leis 
 
 * is laid of what is paft the befter.' 
 
 Mr. Francis niturally took fire on the lead fuf- 
 
 picion of an indignity ofifered to him, but when 
 
 once convinced of his miftake, was no lels ready 
 
 G a to 
 

<#PG# 72>
64- ne HISTORY of 
 
 to repent and acknowledge it 5— he had feen" 
 many inftances of the honour, generoiity, and fin- 
 cerity of Mr. Trueworth 5 he had alio been wrft- 
 T)ieis of fome of the levity and inconfideiateriefs 
 of his fifter, and the reflediion of a niomcn* 
 l^rved to make him lee, this change had happen- 
 ed merely through her own ill conduft. 
 
 His rage abated even while the other was fpeak- 
 ing, but a deep concern remained behind, and 
 throwing himfelf down in a chair, ' Into what 
 
 * vexations,' cried he, may not a whole family be 
 •plunged, through the indifcretion of one wo- 
 
 * man ?' 
 
 * Judge not too raflily,' faid Mr, Trueworth ; 
 •— ' Mils Betfy may one day fee a man fb happy 
 
 * as to infpire her with fcntiments far different 
 
 * from thofe fhe hitherto has entertained, and fhe 
 
 * alTo may be more happy herfelf, with a man who 
 ♦loves her with lels delicacy than I did.' 
 
 The brother of mifs Rctly teemed not to take 
 iny notice of thele words, but rifing in fome con- 
 f^.fion 5 * Well, fir,' faid he, ' l' fhali trouble 
 
 * you no more upon this fnbjec^, — and am forry 
 
 * I have done it now.'— Mr.Truewotth then told 
 him, that though the intended allian^re between 
 them was broke off, he faw no occallon that their 
 friendfhip Ihould be fotoo j — that he Hioxud ht 
 glad of an opportunity To return the favours hd 
 had received fiom him, in relation to his fifter, 
 though hisendeavonrs on that fcore had not met 
 with the defired fuccefs ; and that he hoj>ed they 
 fhould not live as ftrangers while they continued 
 in the fame town : •— to all this Mr. Francis made 
 but very fliort replies, ^ithef taking what he faid 
 as words of courle, or becaufe the difoider of his 
 own mind w<mM not permit him to prolong the 
 eonverlktion. 
 
 It is likely Mr. Trueworth was not much 
 
 troubled 
 

<#PG# 73>

 troubled at the hafty leave this young gentleman 
 took j for though he always had a very fincere 
 regard for him, yet the point, on which he now 
 had come, was tender, and could not be rouched 
 upon without giving him fome pain j— he had 
 no time however to make many reflections on the 
 converfation had pafled between them.—— A 
 letter was brought him by a porter, who waiting 
 for an anlwer, he immediately opened it, and 
 found the contents as follow 5 
 
 To Charles Trueworth, Efcj^

 Mr. True^'orth covid not avoid looking on this 
 
 adventwre as a very odd one j yet whether the 
 
 G 3 propofal 
 

<#PG# 74>
6€- rhe HlSTOWf'^^ 
 
 propofal was real or feigned, the matter was 
 wholly indifferent to him, and he hefitated not a

 down immediately, and wrote, as defired, the 
 following anfwer ; 
 
 To the UfjKNowi?. ; 
 
 • Sir, or Madam, _ ■'!•

 He had no fooner difpatched the mefienger 
 who brought this, than a iecond came and pre-^ 
 lenicd him with another, and had orders alio to 
 wait for an anfwer;— ■■he prefently knew it 
 came fiom mifs Flora, and expefted the contents 
 to be fuch as he found them on perufing :

<#PG# 76>
6B The HISTORY of 
 
 any one, which gave him Co much caufe of repet>- . 
 unce, as that wherein he had commenced an a- 
 mour with a woman of fo violent a temper 5 — :he 
 had never loved her, and all the liking he ever 
 had of her being now utterly erafed by a more lau- 
 dable impreflion, the guilty pleal'ures he had en- 
 jojed with her were now irkfome to his remem- 
 brance, and the more fhe endeavoured to revive > 
 the tender folly in him, the more fhe grew dif* 
 tafteful to him. 
 
 It fo little becomes a woman, whofe charafle- > 
 riftic fhould be modefty, to ufe any endeavours to 
 enforce defire, that thofe who do it are Ture to 
 convert love into indifference, and indifference 
 into loathing and contempt : — even fhe, who, 
 with the greateft feeming delicacy, labours to re- 
 kindle a flame once extinguifhed, will find the 
 truth of what Morat fays in the play : 
 
 ' To love once pafs'd we cannot backward 
 ' move 5 
 
 * Call yefterday again, and we may love.' 
 
 Mr. Trueworth, however, had fo much pity 
 for that unfortunate creature, that he would have 
 given, perhaps, good part of his eftate, that fhe 
 no longer loved him j but how to turn the tide of 
 ib extravagant a paffion, he could not yet refolve, 
 and it being near the time, in which he knew they 
 would expe6l him at Sir Bazil's, where he now 
 dined every day, and the mefJenger who brought 
 the letter alfo growing impatient to be difpatched, 
 he wrote in hafle thefe few lines : 
 
 To Mifs Flora Mellasin. 
 
 * Madam, 
 
 * T^USINESS of the greatefl confeijuence now 
 
 * '■-' calls upon me, and I have no time to write

 ' • p. S. I /hall take it as a favour, madam, that 
 
 * you will henceforward forbear to make any 
 
 * enquiry concerning me at the coiFee houfe, or

 Having given this to mifs Flora's porter, he 
 hafted away to fir Bazil's, there to compofe his 
 mind, after the embarrafiTments it had luftained 
 I that morning. 
 
 C H A P. IX. 
 
 Comaim very link to the purpqfe* 
 
 MR. Francis Thoughtlefs had no fooner left 
 the lodgings of Mr. Trueworth, than he 
 ' went dire<Slly to thofe of his fifter Betfy, where, 
 ; m the humour he then was, the reader will eafily 
 : fuj:'?'>fe, he could not be very good company : — • 
 ; aft'if telling her he had feen Mr. Trueworth, and 
 
 had fome converfation with him on her account,— 
 ' ' I i?.m now convinced,' faid he, * of what before I 
 
 *■ doubted not, that by your own ill management, 
 ' *vand want ofajuft fenfe of what is for yourinte- 
 
 * reft and happinefs, you have loft an opportunity 
 
 * of eftabli/hing both, which can never be re-. 
 , * trieved J — nor is this all, "••your manner of be- 
 ' *'haviour not only ruins yourfelf, but mvolves all 
 
 '— r ' • belonging 
 

<#PG# 78>
70 The HISTORY of 
 
 * belonging to you in endlefs quarrels and perplex- 
 
 * ities.' 
 
 Thefe were reproaches which Mifs Betfy had 
 too much fpirit to have borne from any one but a 
 brother, and even to him, /he was far from yield- 
 ing that fhe had in any meafurc deferved them :— 
 
 * I defy Trueworth himfelf,' cried ihe, with all 
 the refentment of a, dilappointed lover in her 
 heart, * to accufe me of one aSion, that the flriifl- 
 
 * eft virtue could condemn.' 
 
 * Ah, fiftcr,' replied he, * do not let your va-' 
 
 * nity deceive you on this fcore:^— I fee very 
 
 * plainly, that Mr. Trueworth regards you with 
 
 * too much indifference to retain refentment for 
 •any treatment you have given him 5— that he 
 
 * once loved you I am well affured ^ that he no 
 
 * longer does fo, is owing to yourfelf: — but I 
 * /hall mention him no more, — the paffion he 
 
 * had for you is extinguifhed, I believe, beyond 
 
 * all poffibility of reviving, nor would I wifh you 
 ' to attempt it : — I would only have you remem- 
 
 * ber what Mr. Goodman uttered concerning you 
 
 * with almoft his dying breath ; for my own part, 
 
 * I have not been a witnefs of your condu<5l, fince 
 
 * the unhappy brulee I fell into on your account 
 
 * at Oxford, which I then hoped would bea fuf- 
 *ficient warning for your future condufl.' 
 
 If Mifs Betfy had been lefs innocent, it is pro- 
 bable fhe would have replied in a more fatisfac- 
 tory manner to ber brother's reproaches 5 but the 
 real difdain fhe always had for whatever had the 
 leaft tendency to difhonour, made her zealous in- 
 defending herfelf only in things, of which Ihe 
 was not accufed, and too fiient in regard of thofe, 
 in which fhe was judged blame-worthy. 
 
 * What avails your being virtuous?' faid Mr. 
 Francis: — *! hope,-— and I believe you are 
 *lbj — but your reputation is of more confe- 
 
 * q^uence 
 

<#PG# 79>
Mi/s Betsy Thoughtless. 71 
 
 * <]uence to your family : — the lofs of the one 
 
 * might be concealed, but a blemifh on the other 
 
 * brings certain infamy and difgrace on yourfelf, 
 
 * and all belonging to you.' 
 
 On this, file afTumed the courage to tell him, 
 his way of reafoning was neither juft nor delicate. 
 — * Would you,' faid fiie, * be guilty of a bafe 
 ' aflion, rather ^han have it fufpefted that you 
 
 * were fb ?' — ' No,' anlwered he j' * but virtue is 
 •* a different thing in our fex, to what it is in 
 
 * yours 5 — the forfeiture of what is called virtue 
 ' in a woman is more a folly than a bafeneis j but 
 
 * the virtue of a man is his courage, hisconllancy, 
 
 * his probity, which if he lofes, he becomes con- 
 ' temptible to himfelf, as well as to the world.' 
 
 * And certainly,' rejoined Mifs Betfy, with 
 fome warmth, ' the lofs of innocence mufl ren- 
 
 * der a woman contemptible to herfelf, though 
 
 * fhe fhould happen to hide her tranfgreffion 
 
 * from the world,' — ' That may be,' fai3 
 Mr, Francis ; ' but then her kindred fuffer not 
 
 * through her fault : — the remorfe, and the vexa- 
 ' * tion ^Or what fhe has done, is all her own. — In- 
 ' * deed, fifter,' contintied he, * a woman brings 
 
 * lefs difhonour upon a family, by twenty private^ 
 
 * fins, than by one public indifcredon.' 
 
 * Well,' anfwered ihe, ' I hope I fiiall always 
 '* take care to avoid both the one and the other, 
 '*for my own lake,'— As to indulging myfelf 
 '* with the innocent pleai'ures of the town, I have 
 '* the example of fbme ladies of the firft quality, 
 '* and befl reputation, to juflify me in it.' 
 
 Mr. Thoughrlels was about to make fome re- 
 iply, which, perhaps, would have been pretty 
 ikeen, but was prevented by the coming in of 
 Iher maid, who delivering a letter to her, and fay- 
 ling, ' From fir Frederick Fineer, madam,' /lie 
 Ihaliily broke it open, and having read it, bid the

 ' loft every good offer in lofing Mr. Trneworth.' 
 '•— ' I wifii you have not,' anfwered he liillenly. 
 -—He took the paper, however, and read the 
 contents of it, which were thefe :

 tently lovely Mils Betsy Thoughtless.

 to mirth, he could not, in fpite of his ill humour, 
 refrain laughing, on reading feme exprefllons in 
 this heroical learned epiftle:— .' I need not afk/ 
 laid he, throwing the letter contemptuoufly on 
 the table, ' who, or what this new adorer of yours 
 Vis : — it is eafy to fee he is either mad or a fool, 
 
 * or thinks to make you fo.' 
 
 ' I have as bad an opinion of his intelleifls as 
 
 * you have,' replied (he 5 ' but I afiTure you he is 3 
 
 * baronet, and the prefumprive heir of a much 
 
 * greater title, and has an eftare large enough to 
 
 * keep me a coach and twelve, if the cuftoni of the 
 
 * country permitted.' 
 
 Mr. Francis paufed for a few moments, and after 
 looking over the letter again, -« I wifh, faid he, 
 
 * inftead of a fool of fafhion, he is not a knave in 
 
 * the difguife of a coxcomb j-— his ftupidity feems 
 
 * to me to be too egregious to be natural,— all 
 
 * his expreffions have more the appearance of a 
 ' fludied affeftation, than of a real folly ^ — take

 * tors in this town, who are continually on rhe 
 ' watch for young ladies, who have loft their pa- 
 ' rents, and live in the unguarded manner you 
 
 * do.' 
 
 Mifs Betfy leemed to treat her brother's fufpi- 
 cions on this head with a good deal of contempt: 
 — =— /he told him, that the perfon, at whole houfe 
 fhe became acquainted with fir Frederick, knew 
 his circumftances perie(3:ly well, — that he had 9. 
 prodigious eflate, — was of a very ancient and ho- 
 nourable faraily, and converfed with feveral peo- 
 ple ot the ii'-(t quality in England j— ' How- 
 ' ever,' added Ihe, — ' yv'»u may call h^-re this after- 
 ' noon, and fee him yourtelf if you ple^fe 5 for, 
 * according to my judgment, he has not wit enough

 lee fo extraordinary a perfon,if he were not obligetl 
 to go upon fome hufinefs, relating to the com- 
 miffion he was i'olliciting, which he feared would 
 detain hitn beyond the hour, — but with your 
 
 * leave,' laid he, ' I will take this letter with me, 
 
 * and hear what my brother thinks of ir.' 
 
 Tothis Mifs Betfy readily agreed, and he went 
 away in lomewhat of a better humour than he had 
 entered, or that he had put her into by the fevere 
 reprimands he had given her. 
 
 She had a very tender regard for her brothers, 
 but did not think it their province to prefcribe 
 rules for her behaviour 5 — jhe looked upon her- 
 lelfas a better judge in what manner it would be- 
 come her to a6l, than they could pofltbly be, as 
 having lived more years in London than either of 
 them had done months, and if fhe was willing to 
 be advifed, would not lubmit to be dircded by 
 them. 
 
 Thus did her pride a while fupport herfpirits, 
 but when fhe reflected on the affair of Mr. True- 
 worth, and the reafons ftie had given him for 
 fpeaking and thinking of her in that eooi and in- 
 different manner, flie found he now did, ihe be- 
 gan to be fomewhat lels tenacious, and acknow-

 She had alfo a more juft and lively idea of the 
 merits of Mr Truewortb,than ever fhe had been ca- 
 pable of entertaining, while he profefled himfelf 
 her lover : —the amiablenefs of his perlon, — his 
 fine underftanding, — his generofity,— his bravery, 
 — his wit, and the delicacy and elegance of his 
 converfation, feemed to her impoflihle to be e- 
 qualled j — /he confidered too, that his eftate was 
 much beyond what her fortune could expert, and 
 that even his family was fuperior to her's, and 
 could not help being very feniibly aflfefled, that 
 /lie had fo rafhly thrown away her pretenfions to 
 the heart of fo valuable a man.

 MifsBetfy was about to make fome reply, when

 Thoughtlefs defired to fpeak with' her, on which 
 /he arofe haltily, and went, to the top of the flair- 
 cafe to hear what meflage he had to deliver to 
 her, and was pleafingly furprifed when he told 
 her, that his mailer defired the favour of her com- 
 pany to fupper immediately at his houfe.— As 
 ihtt never had an invitation there before, fhe was 
 at a lofs to guefs what could have cauled fo fudden 
 an alteration j— -Ihe afked the fellow what com- 
 pany was there : ^— he told her, only Mr. Francis, 
 and another gentleman whofe name he knew not, 
 but believed they wanted her on I()me affairs con- 
 cerning the late Mr, G' odnian, becaufe as he was 
 waiting, he heard them often mention that gen- 
 tleman and lady Mellafin. 
 
 Though file could not conceiv^e on what pur- 
 pofe fhe W35 to be confulted on any thing relating . 
 to Mr. Goodman, yet flie was extremely glad, 
 that any occafion had happened to induce her bro- 
 ther to fend for her to his houfe, and ordered the 
 man to acquaint his mailer, that fhe would not 
 fail to wait upon him, with as much expedition 
 a§ a chair could bring her.

 fer, till another opportunity, any farther dilcourfe 
 on the fubje(5l they had been talking of. — Having 
 faid this, /he called haftily for her fan and gloves, 
 
 and at the lame time gave orders for a chair. - 
 
 Sir Frederick feemed very much confounded, but 
 finding that any attempt to detain her would be 
 impraiflicable, took his leave, laying, ' You are

 reader may perhaps now begin to think fhe has 
 been too long neglected, it is therefore proper to 
 proceed direftly to Ibme account, how that guilty 
 and unfortunate woman behaved, after being 
 driven in the manner already related from the 
 houfe of her much-injured husband. — Mr. Good- 
 ; man was adviled by his lawyer to be extremely 
 private in the prolecution he was going to com- 
 mence againft her, and by no means to let her 
 ' know the fecret of her criminal converfation wilh 
 Marplus had been difcovered to him ; — this 
 feemed a caution neceflary to be obferved, in or- 
 der to prevent her from taking any meafures, 
 either to invalidate the evidence of the witnefies, 
 or prevail upon them to abfcond, when the proof 
 of what they had Iworn againft her fhould be ex- 
 peciled : — — the whole dete£^ion of her guilt was 
 deligned to come at once upon her like a thunder- 
 cbp, and thereby all the little efforts of artifice 
 :and chicanry, to which flie, doubtlefs, would 
 .'orherwife have had recourfe, be rendered of no 
 ufe, nor give the leaft impediment tojuftice. 
 
 Accordingly, this zealous aflertor of his client's 
 xaufe went to vifit her, as of his own good will j 
 
 flattered her with the hope, that her hul- 
 
 band would foon be prevailed upon to take her 
 ^home again, and lent her feveral fmall fums of 
 money to fupply her neceffities, faying, at the 
 ifame time, that when matters were made up be- 
 :tween them, and all was over, he very well knew 
 fMr. Goodman would return it to him with thanks. 
 
 This ftratagem had the eflfeifl it was intended 
 ■for j ■ ■ ■ ■ ' ■■ it not only kept her from attempting 
 lany thing of the nature abovementioned, but alio 
 from running Mr. Goodman into debt, which cer- 
 tainly fhe might have done, on fome pretence or 
 other, in fpite of all the care and means that could 
 iiave been taken to deftroy her credit.

 It miift be acknowledged, indeed, that afling . 
 in this manner was a prodigious piece of diflimu- 
 lation ; but, at the fame time, it muft be acknow- . 
 ledged alfo, that it was abundantly juftified by 
 the caufe, and praflifed for the moll laudable 
 end, to lerve an honeft, worthy gentleman, his 
 friend and client, againft a woman, who had - 
 wronged him in the tenderefl: point, and who was . 
 capable of making ufe of the vileft methods to 
 elude the punifhment her crimes deferved 5 and 
 2s a great author tells us, 
 
 ' It is a kind of Itupid honefly, 
 
 * Among known knaves, to play upon the . 
 * fquare,' 
 
 Lady Mellafin, however, was lulled into fo . 
 peifeif^ a fecurity by her depcndance on the good- 
 nature of her husband, and the tender afFe6lion 
 he had always fliewn to her, as well as by the , 
 high charailer fhe had always heard of the law- . 
 yer's veracity, that fhe was more eafy than could 
 have been expeded, in a woman of her fituation, . 
 even though it had been as fhe was made to be- 
 lieve. 
 
 She received, and returned with her ufual po- 
 litenefs and gaiety, the vifits that were made her . 
 by all thofe who thought proper to continue an 
 acquaintance with her 5 -^. — fhe pretended that it 
 was only a little family contefl, that had feparated . 
 her from Mr. Goodman for a fliort time 5 and 
 always mentioned him with fo much kindneisand 
 refpefl, as made every one believe, there was no- • 
 thing between them, but what would be eafily 
 made up. 
 
 This was indeed the mofl prudent method fl^e 
 "could take, not only to preferve her own reputa- ' 
 tion to the world, but alfo to give Mr, Goodman 
 a high idea of her conduft, if what ihe laid ,' 
 ihould happen to be repeated to him.

 She was every day in expe6lation, that through 
 her own good management, and the interceflion 
 of the lawyer, whom /he now took to be her 
 ffciunch friend, all would be Over, and flie fhould 
 be recalled home, when a cirarion to appear be- 
 fore the doftors of the civil law was delivered to 
 her, by an officer belonging to that court. 
 
 It IS more eafy to conceive than defcribe her 
 diltraftion, at i'o unlooked-for a turn j — /lie now 
 found, that her intriegue with Marplus was dif- 
 cin-ered, and that all fhe had to dread, was like to 
 fall upon her by that event j her perplexity was 
 alfo greatly increafed, by her not being able to 
 find out by whom, or by what means fhe had been 
 betrayed 3 — flie fent immediately in fearch of 
 Marpius, whom, fince his arrefting Mr, Goodman, 
 fhe had never once feen, nor heard any thing of 5 
 fbut all the information fhe could get of him, was, 
 that he had been thrown in prifon by Mr, Good- 
 man, and after confinement of a few days, had 
 been releafed, and was gone nobody knew where, 
 but as it was fuppofed out of England 3 — that 
 his wife had likewile remove'd from her lodgings, 
 but whether with an intention to follow him, or 
 not, no certain intelligence could be given. 
 
 As this unhappy woman, therefore, neither 
 knew on what foundation the accufation againft 
 her was built, nor what evidences could be pro- 
 duced to prove it, fhe might very well be bewil- 
 dered in her thoughts, and not know what courle 
 to take 5 yet amidft all thefe matters of aflonifh- 
 ment, — opprefled with grief, and flruck with 
 horror at the near profpe^l of approaching infamy, 
 /he had courage, and prefence enough of mind, to 
 enable her to do every thing that was neceflary for 
 her defence in fo bad a caufe, 
 
 Mr. Goodman's indifpofition putting a flop to 
 the procefs, flie had time to confult with thole

 whom file found moft qualified for the purpofe 5 jli 
 
 her chief agent was a pettifogger, or under- \n

 it, and as the extreme indigence of his circum- 
 ilances made him ready to undertake any thing; 
 though never fo defperate, provided it afforded a 
 profpeiS of advantage, fo he had impudence and 
 cunning enough to go through with it, even to 
 the hazard of his ears. 
 
 This man kept up her fpirits, by affiiring her,

 againfl her 5 but there was no opportunity for him 
 to exercife his abilities this way, fon Mr. Good-

 Then followed fome other legacies tc feveral

 and did not amount in the whole to above feven or

 i?n in this manner : 
 
 * Item, I give and bequeath to my dear nephew,

 was dated about ten days before Mr. Goodmaii 
 died ^«— he knew, that the elder Mr. Thought- 
 lefs came every day to vifit him, during the whole 
 time of his {scknefs, and that Mifs Betfy, at the 
 time this will was ilippofed to be made, a6lually 
 Jived in the Iioufe, and that neither of thele two 
 could be torajly ignorant of fr.ch a tranfa^ion, in 
 cafe any fuch had been. 
 
 It was therefore on the lawyer's requeff, that 
 Miis Betfy was Tent for to her brother's houfe ^-" 
 /lie anfwered with a great deal of readinefs, to all 
 the quertions he put to her, according to the beil 
 of her knowledge, particularly, as to that concern- 
 ing the making the will, flie faid, that flie had ne- 
 ver heard the leaft mention of any lawyer but' 
 himfelf coming to Mr. Goodman's, during the • 
 whole time of his ficknefs, and that fiie verily be- • 
 lieved, no will, but that drawn up by him, and 
 which all the family knew of, could poflibly be 
 made by Mr. Goodman's orders, or in his houfe j 
 and as to the article in the pretended will, rela- 
 ting to mifs Flora, nothing could be a more pftl- 
 pable forgery, becaufe Mr. Goodman had ('fferetl 
 five hundred pounds with her in marriage to a 
 linen-draper, not above fix weeks bef )re his part- 
 ing with lady MelJafin, ' which,' added /he ' is 
 
 * a very plain proof, that he never intended heir

 no longer helitated to pronounce her own doom, 
 and cry out fhe was undone. 
 
 The excui'e he made of biifinels was too weak, 
 — too trire, — too common place to gain any cre- 
 dit with her, or alleviate her forrows^ — flie 
 Icnew the world too well to imagine a young gay 
 gentleman, like him, would forego whatever he 
 thought a pleafure, for any bulineis he could pof- 
 fibly have ; •■ fhe doubted not but there was a 
 woman in the cafe, and the thoughts that, while 
 /lie was in vain expefting him, he was folliciting 
 thofe favours from a rival, fl»e had fo laviflily be- 
 llowed, and languiflied to rcpear, fired her jea- 
 lous brain, even to a degree of frenzy. 
 
 Awhile file raved with all the wild defpairof 
 ill requited buming love, but other emotions fbon 
 rofe in her diftrafled bofbm not to controul, but 
 add frefh fewel to the flame already kindled there : 
 •—'My circumflances !' cryed fhe 5 'my 
 
 * wretched circumflances 1 — — What will become 
 
 * of me ? • involved in my motther's lliame, he 
 
 * will, perhaps, make that a pretence for abandon- , 
 
 * ing me to thofe misfortunes, I thought 1 might ) 
 
 * have depended on him to relieve. 
 
 However, as the little billet, in anfwer to her 
 laft letter to him, contained a promife that he 
 would write to her the next day, fhe endea- 
 voured, as much as (lie was able, to compofe her- 
 ielftill that time, though fiie was far from hoping 
 the explanation fhe expefled to receive in it, 
 would afFord any confolation to her tormented 
 mind. 
 
 Mr. Trueworth alfo, in the mean time, was 
 not without his own anxieties :—— a man of ho- 
 nour frequently finds more difficulty in gettiixg rid 
 of a woman he is weary of, and loves him, than 
 obtaining a wonian he loves, and is in puifuit of; 
 
 but

 but this gentleman had a more than ordinary per- 
 plexity to ftiiiggle through: few women 
 
 would go the lengths Mifs Flora had done for the 
 accompliihment oF her defires, and he ea'aly faw, 
 by the whole tenor of her behaviour, ihe would 
 go as great, and even more to continue the enjoy- 
 ment of them. \ 
 
 Glad would he have been to have brought her 
 by degrees to an indifference for him, — to have 
 prevailed on her to fubmit her paffiun to the go- 
 vernment of her reafon, and to be convinced, that 
 an amour, fuch as their's had been, ought to.be 
 looked upon only as a tr^nflent pleafure j— »to be 
 continued while mutual inclination and conve- 
 nience permitted, and when broke off remem- 
 bered but as a dream. 
 
 But this he found was not to be done with a 
 woman of mils Flora's temper ; — he therefore 
 thought it bell not to keep her any longer in fuf- 
 pence, but let her know at once the revolution 
 in her fate, as to that point, which regarded him, 
 and the true motive that had occalioned it, which 
 he accordingly did in thefe terms :

 Mr. Trueworth flattered himfelf, that fo plain 
 a declaration of his fentiments, and intentions, 
 would put a total end to all future correipondence 
 between them, and having looked it over, after 
 he had finiflied and found it fuch as he thought 
 proper for rhe purpofe, put it under a cover, with 
 all the letters he had received from Mifs Flora, 
 not excepting the firff invitation fhe had made 
 him, under the title of the Incognita, and lent 
 away the packet by a porter j for he had never 
 cnrruited his fervants with the conveyance of any 
 epiftle from him to that lady. 
 
 Mifs Flora, from the moment her eyes were 
 open in the morning, if it can be fuppoled flie 
 had any fieep that night, had been watching with 
 the nioft: racking impatience for the arrrival of 
 Jvlr. Trueworth's meflenger^- — fhe wifhed, but

 peiSled would be contained in the mandate he had 
 promiled to fend, yet was diftra6led for the cer- 
 tainty, how ciuel foever it might prove. 
 
 At length it canie, and with it a confirmation 
 of even worfe than the moft terrible of her appre- 
 henfions had fiiggefted : — - the fight of her own 
 letters on her opening it, almoil threw her into a 
 fwoon 5 but when her ftreaming eyes had greedily 
 devoured the contents of the billet that accompa- 
 nied them, excels of defperation ftruck her for 
 Ibme moments ftupid, and rendered her mind in- 
 adiive as her frame. 
 
 But when awakened from this lethargy of filent 
 grief, fhe felt all the horrors of a fare (lie had fo 
 much dreaded : — fruftrated at once in every hope, 
 that love or intereft had prefenrcd to her, words 
 cannot paint the wildneis of her fancy •—» fhe 
 tore her hair and garments, and fcarce Ipired that 
 face, (lie had taken fo much pains to ornament, 
 foi- wanting charms to fecur^; the conqucll it had 
 gained. 
 
 But with the more violence thofe tourbiJIions 
 of the mind rage for a waile, the fuoner they

 all thife difturbed emotions, which naturally at- 
 tend the breaking of an acquaintance fuch as their's 
 had bi.en, but i: alfo eftablinied in him, a very

 Mifs "Betfys innocence, as to the jDenham affair^ 
 fully cleareA up to Mr. True-worth, by a very 
 extraordinary accident, 
 
 MR. Tnieworth had made fo j^reat a pro.^refs 
 in his coiirtlhip, that the Sincerity of Miis 
 Harriot got the better of her bafhfulnefs, even 
 fo tar as to confefs to him, it was with pleaTure 
 ihe yielded to the perfuafions of her friends, in 
 favour of his love, and that he har iiifinnelv the 
 preference of all ruankind in her elleem j in iine, 
 ; her behaviour was fuch, as left nothing wanting 
 I but the ceremony to afiiire him of his happinefs. 
 Sir Bazil alio having concluded every thing 
 with the father of his miftrefs, brought that 
 young lady acquainted with his lifters, u'ho, 
 highly approving their brother's choice, foon 
 I treated her, and were treated by her, with the 
 fame afFeftion and familiarity as if already united. 
 There were few hours, excepting thofe allotted 
 I by nature and cuflom for repoi'e, which this 
 amiable company did not pafs together 5 the old 
 gentleman, who was extretnely good humoured, 
 ' when nothing relating to the parting with his mor 
 tneycameon the carpet, would frequently -make 
 ( one among them, and being one day more than 
 (Ordinarily chearfol, told Mr. Trueworth, that as 
 Ihe found the two weddings were to be folemnized 
 iin one day, and he fhould give his daughter's 
 ihand to fir Basil, deiired he might alfo have the 
 I honour of bellowing Mifs Harriot's upon himj — 
 ito which Mr, Trueworth replied, that he fhould 
 •joyfully receive her from any hands, but more 
 jparticuiarly from hisj— — and that he took the 
 offer he made him as a very great favour : — on. 
 this, the other grew very gay, and faid abundance 
 
 of

 of merry things, to the no fmall cxpence of 
 bluflies, both in his daughter and Mils Harriot. 
 
 It is impoffible for any lovers, while waiting 
 for the conrummation of their wifhes, to enjoy a 
 more uninterrupted felicity, than did fir Bazii and 
 Mr. Triieworth : — ■ continually bleft with the fo- 
 ciety of their dear miflieiGres, and receiving from 
 them all the marks, that a virtuous afFedion could 
 beftow, yet both of them found it requifite to 
 contrive every day feme new party (<f piearure or 
 other, in order to beguile the neceflary, though 
 to them tedious, time it took up in drawing of 
 writings, and other preparations for the fo much 
 longed-for nuptials, which Mrs. Wellmr did not 
 fail to do all on her part to haften, being impati- 
 ent to return to her family, whence Ihe had been 
 abfent longer than fhe had intentled. 
 
 Sir Bazil and Mr. Trueworth having been 
 taking a little walk in the park one tBorning, the 
 former finding himfelf io near the habitation of 
 Mifs Mabel, could not fotbear calling on her, 
 thougli fhe was to dine that day at his houle, and 
 Mr. Trueworth readily accompanied him '— that: 
 lady was then at her toilet, but made no icruple 
 of admitiing them into her di effing- room, where 
 they had fcarce feated themfelves, when her wo- 
 man, who was waiting, was called out by a foot- 
 man to fpeak to ihme^ people, who, he faid, were 
 very importunate to fee Mifs Mabel, and would 
 take no anfwer from him. 
 
 ' Rude gueils, indeed,' cried Mifs Mabel, 
 'that will not take an anivver froni a fervnnt : — , 
 ' Who are they?' ' I never faw them before,: 
 
 * madam,' replied the footman j ' but the one is a- 
 
 * woman of a very mean appearance, and the o- 
 
 * ther, I believe, is a foldier: — I told them' 
 ' your ladyfhip had company, and could not be 
 
 ' leen 3 but the man faid, he only begged one 
 
 * word

 ' word with you, that he was jiifl come from 
 
 ' abroad, and wanted to know where he might 
 ' fee his child, and a deal of fuch ftulT: — the 
 '-woman is almoft as impertinent as the man, 
 ' and 1 cannot get them from the door.' 
 
 * I will lay my life upon it, madam,' i'aid rhe 
 Iwaiting-maid, '"that this is the father ot the child, 
 ' that you and Mils Betiy Thoughtlefs have been 
 ' lb ^ood to keep, ever iince the mothei's death.' 
 — ' I verily believe thou haft hit upon the li^hr,' 
 died Mils Mabel j' — ' prithee go down, and if it 
 ' be as thou imagineft, bid them come up, — •! 
 * will fee them.' 
 
 The maid went as (he was ordered, and imme- 
 diately reruriicd with two perfons, fuch as the 
 
 footman had defcribed : —— the woman was the 
 tfirfi: that advanced, and after drijpping two or 
 ! three courtfies (o each of the company, addrefied 
 
 iherfelf to Mils ?vkbel in thefe words : ' I do 
 
 ,'* not know, madam,' laid fhe, ' whether your 
 '' lady'hip may remember me, but I nurfed poor . 
 '• Mrs. Jinks, your ladyfhip's fempftrefs and clear- 
 ''ftarcher, all the time of her lying-in, when your

 I ' took the child, that it mi«ht not go to the

 ' I remember you very well,' replied MifsMa-

 "and is refolved to take up and ferrle in the

 * he would willingly have his child.' 
 
 ' O! doabrlefs, he may have his child,' re- 
 joined Mils Mabel : — ' but barkye, friend,' con- 
 tinued ilie, turning to the man, ' are you able to

 he, coniir,g forward, ' thank God, and good'

 ty liule farm there j — and fb, as my neighbour ' 
 here was telling you, I would not have my 
 child a buriheii to any body.' — 'If we had 
 thought it a burthen,' laid Mils Mabel, ' we 
 fliould not have taken it upon us 3—— however, 
 I am gUd you are in circumftances to mamtain it 
 yourfelf 5— - your wife was a very honeft, in- 
 duflnous woman, and luffered a great deail 
 through your negleft, but I hope you will make 
 it up in the care of the child flie has left behind.' 
 ' A3e, madam,' replied he, wiping his eyes, 
 I have nothing elfe to remember herj — Idid 
 not ufe her fo well as flie deferved, that's cer- 
 tain, but I have lowed all my wild oats, as the 
 faying is, and I vvifii (he were'alive to have the 
 benefit of it.' 
 
 ' Tluit cannot be,' interrupted the woman, ' To 
 don't trouble good madam with your forrowful 
 Itories j— — if herladyOiip will be fo good only 
 to give us (hiections where to find the child, for 
 we have been to madam Betiy''', and her lady- 
 fi'iip was not at home, fb we m ide bold to come 
 here.' — ' Yes, madam,' cried he, ' for my colo- 
 nel comes to town in a day or two, and I Hiall 
 get my difcharge, and have no more to do with 
 the fervice, {<> would willingly have my child 
 to take down wi:h ine to the faini.' 
 Mifs lyiabel made no other anfwer to this, than 
 faying, it was very well, and immediately gave 
 them the direiSion they requefled, to Goody 
 
 Bufliman's, at Denham. 'I cannot tell you 
 
 Ve.xaflly where the houie is,' faid Ihe, ' but you 
 ' will eafily find her, the husband is a gardener,

 The fellow feemed extremely pleafed, thanked 
 Tier as well as he could in his homely fafhion, 
 and defired fhe would be fh kind to give hi^duty 
 to the other lady, and thank her alfo, for her part 
 of the favours both his wife and child had re- 
 ceived, nor had he forgot his manners fo far, as 
 not to accompany thefe teftimonies of his gratitude 
 with a great many lew icrapes, till he got quite 
 out of the room. 
 
 After this fir Bazil began to grow a little plea- 
 fant with Mifs Mabel, concerning the motherly 
 part fhe had been aftihg : — ' You do me more 
 ■ * honour than I deferve,' laid fhe laughing ^ ' for it 
 "* was but half a child I had to take care of, Co con- 
 ^'lequenrly I could be but half a mother. — I am 
 
 * glad, however,' continued Ihe, more ierioufly, 
 
 * that my little god-daughter has found a father.' 
 
 While they were talking in this manner, the 
 ©Id gentleman happening to come in, and hear- 
 ing fir Bazil was above with his daughter, fent to 
 defire to fpeak with him in his clolet. 
 
 Mils Mabel being now alone with Mr. True- 
 ^worth, thought (lie faw fomething in his counte- 
 nance, which very much furnrifed her, — «»' You 
 
 * are penfive, fir,' fiid /he ;— ' I hope f'le nien- 
 
 * tion we have been making of Mtfs Betfy has 
 '■given you no alarm.' — ' A very great one/ 
 anfwered he 5 ' but not on the account you may

 'in the moft cruel tni.inerj — arrJ' t ho igh the

 Never was allonifhment equal to that Mifs Ma- 
 bel was in, on hearing the narrative of fb mon-

 having a little vented her indignation on ail who 
 were capable of the like practices j — ' I iuppofe

 the violence of his paflion, it came into her head,' 
 that there was a poffibility of his being already mar- 
 ried, or contracted, to f(>n.e lady, whom he durft 
 not break with, but being bent on gaining her at 
 all events, he had formed this pretence of a vow; 
 in order to gain her to a clandeftine marriage 
 thinking, that after it was over, and ihete was no 
 remedy, /he would be content to live with him 
 in a private manner, fince it would then be im- 
 pradlicable for her to do lb in a public one. 
 
 Tills indeed Hie could not be certain of, but 
 ihe was fo, that it did not become a woman of 
 any fjtnily and cbara6^er to receive the addrefles 
 of a man, how fuperior foever he might be in point 
 offoitune, who either was afhamed, or had any 
 other reafons to hinder him from avowing his pal- ~ 
 , fion to her relations. 
 
 She relblved therefore to put an end at once to 
 a courtfnip^ which, however high her Expec- 
 tations ar firll had been, flie now law no probability 
 would aff.iid her either honour or latisfatSion. 
 
 She had no looner fixed herlelf in this deter- ■

 ianv man the leaft fzrounds to hope /lie approved 
 ,his pretendons, 'till ilie had fiilt received the fanc- 
 jtion ot both his and her brother Thoughtlefs's ap- 
 probation. 
 
 He then told her, that they -had received intel- 
 ligence, that the India (hip, which they l.eard 
 was to bring Mr. Edward Goodman, was lately 
 jrrived in th^; Downs; io that in ;ill likelihood 
 Irhat gentleman would be in London in two or 
 rhree davs at farthelt ;— ' which I am very glad 
 ofjMardhe; ' for though I believe the lawyer a 
 very Honcft, diligent man as any can be of his 
 proleffion, the prelence of the neir will give a 
 • life to the C3u(e, and may bring things to a more 
 fpeedy iHTie.' 
 
 He alto iold her, that a gentleman of his bro- 
 ther's acc]uainr;ince had the day before received a 
 i^tter from fir Ralph Trudy, intimating, that he 
 niou'td be obliged, by the death of Mr. Goodman, 
 here being afifiirs of confequence between them, 
 o come to town much looner than he had intended,

 He was going on in I'ome farther commendati-

 lame to the dining room door, and told her, that 
 Mr. Munden w-'s below in the parlour, and would

 ' Trueworth in perfon and parts.— 'I never told 
 ' you,' ani'wered flie, ' that he did fo in either 5 
 ' but perhaps he may in his good opinion and 
 ' edeem for niej — however, I think you pro- 
 ' mifed never to mention Trueworth again to me-; 
 ' — I wifli you would keep your word.**— ' Well, 
 * — I have done,' faid he, ' do not keep the gen- 
 ' tleman waiting.' — On which flie bade her 
 footman dcfiic Mr. Munden to walk up. 
 
 That gentleman was a good deal difconcerted 
 in his mind, concerning the little progrefs his 
 courtfhip had made with mils Betfy ; — he had 
 followed her for a considerable time,—— been at 
 a great expence in treating and making prefents 
 to her 5-— he had lludied her humour, and done 
 every thing in his power to pleafe her, yet thought 
 himlelf as far from the completion of hisviiflies, 
 as when he began hisaddrefles to her j — — he had 
 not for feveral days had an opportunity of (peaking 
 one word to her in private 5 — — fiie was either 
 abroad when he came, or lo engaged in company^ 
 that his pretence lerved only to fill a vacant feat 
 in her dining-room j— he therefore determined 
 to know what fate he was to expert from her. 
 
 As he had not been told any body, was now wifh 
 her, and had never leen Mr. Francis before, he 
 was a little .ftartled on his coming info the 
 room, to find a young, gay gent]e.man feated 
 very near her, and lolling his arm, in a carelefs 
 pofture, over the back of the cbair in which 
 ihe was fitting j—— on his entrance, they both 
 rofe to receive him with a great .deal of po- 
 litenels, which he returned in the iame-manner j 
 but added to the firft compliment?', that he hoped 
 ' he had been guilty of no inrjut'ion. ; ^,.^, 
 
 'Not at ali, fir,* replied the brother of .\Mifs

 ' and this, brother,' continued fhe, turning to Mr. 
 Francis, * is a gentleman who fometimes does me 
 
 * the honour ofcs'ling upon me, and whofe vifits 
 
 * to me I believe you will not difapprove.' 
 
 She had no fooner ended thefe words than the 
 two gentlemen mutually advanced, embraced, and 
 faid they ihould be proud of each others acquain- 
 tance ; after which they entered into a converiati- 
 on fprightly enough for the time it lafted, which 
 Was not long 5 for Mr. Francis looking on his 
 watch faid, he was extremely mortified to leave 
 ftich good company, but bufinefs of a very urgent 
 nature called him to a different place at that hour. 
 
 As much as Mr. Munden v^'as pleafed to find 
 him felf fo obligingly introduced by his miiiref?, 
 to the acquaintance of her brother, he was equally 
 - glad to be rid of him at this jundlute, when he 
 came prepared to prefs her lo home to an eclair- 
 ciffemenr, as fliould deprive her of all poffibility 
 of keeping himl'elf any longer in fufpence. 
 
 It was in vain for her now to have recourfe to 
 any of thofe evafions by which H^e had hitherto 
 put him off, and fhe found herfelf under a necef- 
 fity either of entirely difcarding him, or giving 
 him fome kind of affurance, that the continuance 
 of his pretenfions would not be in v.^in. 
 
 Never had Ihe been fo plunged before — ne- 
 ver had any of her lovers infifted in fuch plain 
 terms on her declaring herfelf, and (lie was com- 
 pelled, as it were, to tell him, fince he was fo

 who came haftily into the room, and laid, ' Madam, 
 
 * here is Mils Mabel.' 
 
 She had no (boner fpoke thefe words, than the 
 3ady flie mentioned followed her into the room. 
 ■— Mils Betly was never more glad to fee her than 
 now, when her prefence afforded her fo feafon- 
 able a leiief : — ' My dear mils Mabel,' faid flie, 
 ' this is kind indeed, when I already owe you two 
 
 * vifits.' ■■ ■ ' I believe you owe me more,' an- 
 fwered Ihe, with a fmile ; ' but I did not come 
 
 * to reproach you,—— nor can this indeed be juftly 
 
 * called a vifit, fince it is only a meer matter of

 Mr. Munden on this thought proper to take his 
 leave, but, in doing fo, faid to Mifs Berfy, with 
 a very grave air, — ' I hope, madam, you will 
 
 * have the goodnels to confider ferioufly on what 
 ' we have been talking of: — I will do myfelf 
 ' the honour to wait upon your brothers to-mor-

 Mifs Betfy replied, that Hie gtieffed as much, 
 for file had heard thofe people had been at her 
 lodgings, when fiie was not at home, and had 
 faid fomewhat of their biifinefs to her fervant. — • 
 ' 1 am alfo to pay you,' relumed the other, ' my 
 ' quota of the laft month's nurfing.'— — In fpeak- 
 ing thefe words fhe took out of her pocket the 
 little fum fhe itood indebted for, and laid it on 
 the table. 
 
 Though Mifs Betfy had the mofl: perfect regard 
 and good wifhes for Mifs Mabel, and Mils Mabel 
 the lame for Mifs Betfy, yet neither of them was 
 in the lecrets of the other : — they vifited but 
 feldom, and when they did, talked only on indif- 
 ferent affairs.— In fine, though they both loved 
 the amiable qualities each found in the other, yet 
 the wide contrariety between their difpolicions, 
 occafioned a coolnefs in their behaviour, which 
 their hearts were far from feeling. 
 
 Mils Mabel Hayed but a very few minutes, after 
 having dilpatched the bufinefs fhe came upon, 
 nor was Mifs Betfy at all troubled at her departure, 
 being at prelent, what fhe very rarely was, in 
 a- humour rather to be alone than in any company 
 whatever. 
 
 She no fooner was at liberty than file began to

 This propolal put Mi(s Betfy out of all her fe-

 the lady, that (he would not fail to be at home, 
 and ready to attend her at the appointed hour. 
 
 Accordingly, as foon as ever dinner wasover, 
 /he went to drels, and thought of nothing but 
 how to make as brilliant a figure as any (he /hould 
 meet with at the aflembly. — Mils Airifh came 
 Ibmewhat before the hour fhe had mentioned in 
 her letter, accompanied by two rakes of quality, 
 whom Mifs Beti'y had feen two or three times 
 before with her and herfifter, and by one of whom 
 file h:id once been treated with fome familiarities, 
 which had made her ever fince very cautious of 
 giving him any opportunity to ^ttenipt the like.

 As much, therefore, as fl:e had pleafed herfelf 
 with the idea of thjs evening's pleafures, /lie no' 
 Ic oner faw who were to be their condc6tors, than' 
 f].e refolved not to put herfelf into their powers, 
 yet knew not how, without affronting Mifs Airifh,' 
 to avoid complying with the promifes flie had' 
 trade of accompanying her. 
 
 They all came fingmg and romping into the 
 room, but the perplexity of Mifs JBetly's mind 
 made her receive them with a very feriousair:' 
 ■—the men accofled her with a freedom con- 
 formable enough to their own charafteis, but not' 
 very agreeable to one of her's, and Ihe rebuffed' 
 with a good deal of conternpt him, with whom 
 fhe had moft realbn to be offended. 
 
 ' Lord ! how grave you look,' faid Mifs Airifh, 
 obferving her countenance j ' prithee, my dear

 ' is to be a night of all fpirir, — all mirth, — all

 ' Unhand me, my lord,' cried flie, ftruggling 
 I to get loole, — ' what you aft: is impoffible, for

 with v.'hich Hie fpoke thefe words, and the anger 
 1 which at the fame time fparkled in her eyes, made 
 tthem lee it would be but loft labour to endeavour 
 to perluade her 5 they looked one at another, and 
 iwere confounded what to do, till Mifs Airifli, 
 vexed to the very heart at Mils Betfy 's behaviour, 
 ;-hit upon an expedient to folve up the matter': 
 — — * Well,' laid Ihe, ' lince Mifs Betfy cannot 
 ' go, I will introduce your brdfliip to a young 
 ' lady, who, I am lure, will nor refufe us 5— be- 
 1' fides, I know /lie is at home, for I faw her look- 
 ing out of her chamber window as we came by 5 
 ' -;-— but we mufr go direflly, that flie may have 
 time to drels.' 
 On this, they both cried with all their hearts, 
 ;ind one of them taking her hand iliipped down 
 lairs with her, in the fame wild way they came 
 ip : — the other followed, only turning his head 
 owards Mifs Betly, cried, with a malicious Ihcer,

 her meeting them at Mils Airifh's apartment, 
 Ihe had the better opportunity of excufing herfelf

 ^he terrible corjfequences^ which may pojjibly at-

 lainy and hypocrify. 
 
 MISS Betfy no fboner found herfelf alone, than, 
 /he began to refleft very ferioufly on thcf > 
 preceding paflage ;•■■■■ ihe knew very little of, 
 thefe two young noblemen, yet thought Ihe law,,

 who had the leaft regard for her honour or repu- 
 tation, fearful to truft herfelf with them in any.

 — — file was, therefore, very much amazed, that ^ 
 Mils Airifh fhould run fo great a rifque, and to.« 
 find that flie did lb, joined to fome other things, - 
 which file had of late obferved in the condud of 
 both the lifters, contributed to diminifli the Jove -• 
 and efteem flie once had for them. '' 
 
 She found, however, too many obje(fts of fatif- ' 
 faftion in the vifirs Hie made to thole ladies, to 
 be willing to break acquaintance with them, and 
 as (lie doubted not but that Ihe had highly dilo- 
 bliged the one, by not complying with her invi- 
 tation, and that this would infallibly occafion a 
 rupture with the other alfo, if not in time recon- 
 ciled,

 ciled, fhe went the next morning to their apart- 
 ment, in order to make her peace. 
 
 On her enquiring for that lady, the footman told 
 her, fhe was but jufl come home, and he believed 
 was going to-bed, but he would tell the chamber- 
 maid fhe was there.— * No, ——no,' cried Mifs 
 Betfy, ' only give my compliments to your lady, 
 ' and tell her, I will wait on her in the afternoon.^ 
 •■■ •■'■ She was going away with thefe words, bur 
 Mils Airifli, lying on the lame floor, heard her 
 voice, and called to her to come in. 
 
 Mifs Betfy did as fhe was defired, and found 
 her in a much better humour than fhe expelled, 
 ■ ' O, my dear,' faid fiie, what a night have 
 you loft by not being with us !— — Such a.pro- 
 mifcuous enjoyment of every thing that can af- 
 ford delight or farisfa<5iion !— Well, after all, 
 there is nothing like playing the rake a little fbme- 
 times, — — it gives fuch a fillup to the f'pirits,' 
 
 * Provided it be innocent, I am of your m-ind^' 
 
 eplied mtfs Betfy 5— 'I fuppofe every thing 
 
 was managed with decency among you.'— — 
 
 O quite fo,' cried the other 5 — ' all harmlefs li- 
 
 bertinifm : — — 'tis true, there were private 
 
 rooms J but you know one might chule whether 
 
 one would go into them or not.'— • ' I am not 
 
 fure of that,' faid mifs Betiy : -— ' I. am glad 
 
 however you were fo well pleafed with your 
 
 entertainment, and equi'ly fb, that you were 
 
 not hindered from enjeiyrng it, by my not being 
 
 able to fliare with you in it.' 
 
 ' I am obliged to you, my dear,' replied Mifs 
 
 Airifli, — * I was a little vexed with you at firll, 
 
 * indeed, but knew you could not help it 5— the 
 *lady we called upon went very readily with us, 
 ' fo as it happened there was no diikppointnvent

 * It was only to be convinced of that,' faid Mifs 
 Betfy, ' that I came hither thus early ; but I will 
 
 * now take my leave, — - repofe I am fure is necef- 
 
 * fary for you, after fo many waking hours.' ■ — 
 The other did not oppole her departure, being 
 in effeft defirous of taking that reif, which her 
 exhaulled fpirits wanted. 
 
 Never had Mifs Betfy felt within "herfelf a 
 greater or more fincere fatisfafiioii, than (he now 
 did, for having fo prudently avoided falling into 
 inconveniencies, the leaft of which, as flie very 
 rightly judged, would have been paying too dear 
 a price for all the pleafures llie could have re- 
 cieved. 
 
 Sweet indeed are the refle(51ions, which flow 
 from a conlcioufnefs of having done what virtue, 
 and the duty owing to the character we bear in life, 
 exaiSed from us, but poor Mifs Beefy was not 
 to enjoy, for any long time, fo happy a tranquili- 
 tyj— fhe was roufed out of this ferenity of mind, 
 by an adventure of a different kind trom all /he 
 had ever yet experienced, and which, if Jhe were 
 not properly guarded againll", it ought to be im- 
 puted rather to the uniuipefling goodnefs of her 
 heart, than to her vanity, or that inadvertency, 
 which had occafioned her former miftakes. 
 
 She was fitting near the window, leaning heir 
 arm upon the flab, very deep in contemplation, 
 when, hearing a coach flop at the door, flie look- 
 ed out, imagining it might be f )mebody to her, 
 and faw Mrs, Mutiely come out :-» !he wr»ndered 
 what bulinefs that woman fhould now Cf>me upon, 
 after the letter fhe had fenr her, and relolved 
 to chide her for any impertinent meflage fhe 
 fhould deliver. 
 
 Mrs, Modely, whofe profeflion was known to 
 the people of the houfe, always ran up without 
 any other ceremony than afking if Mifs Betfy 
 
 was

 was at home and alone : — being now told /he was 
 io^ Ihe flew into the room, with a diltradion in 
 her countenance which very much furprifed Mifs 
 Betfy 3 bin before flie had time to aflc the mean- 
 ing, the other throwing herfelf down in a chair, 
 increafed her aftonifliment by thefe words : 
 
 ' 01 madam,' cried Hie, ' I am come to tell 
 ' you ot the faddeft accident :»— poor fir Frede- 
 ' rick Fineer ! — O that he had never ieen you ! 
 '——O that I had never meddled between you I 
 
 * — I am undone, that is to ba fure, — ruined for 
 
 * ever : — ■ I fnall never get another lodger, «w nay, 
 
 * I believe, I Hiall never recover the fright I am 
 -in.' 
 
 Here flie burfi: into a violent fit of tears, and 
 
 her fobs interrupting the paffage of her words, 
 
 gave Mifs Betfy opportunity to enquire info the 
 
 myftery of her behaviour : — • ' For heaven's fake, 
 
 '* what is the matter,' faid that young lady ? ' pri- 
 
 ' * thee ceafe thefe exclamations, and fpeak to be 
 
 '^^Ainderllood.' 
 
 1 -r. * Ah, dear Mifs Betfy,' refumed the other, *I 
 '^ fcarce knew what 1 fay or do, —poor fir Fre- 
 '* derick has run himfelf quite through the body.' 
 
 'What! killed himfelf,* cried Mifs Betly 
 
 ihaftily ? — ' He is not dead yet,' replied Mrs.' 
 
 iModely j' * but there he lies the moft difmal ob- 
 
 '*je6t that ever eyes beheld:— the agonies of 
 
 'death in his face,— the f word flicking in his 
 
 * breafl ; for the furgeon fays, that the moment 
 
 • that is drawn out, his life comes with it.' 
 
 Perceiving Mifs Betfy faid nothing, and looked 
 la little troubled, fhe went on in this manner: — 
 '* But this is not the worfl I have to tell you, ma- 
 ' dam,' continued fhe, — ' his death is nothing ; 
 'but it is his foul, — his foul, Mifs Betfy: —

 ' What good can I do him by going Mrs. Mode-

 They faid little more to each other, 'till they 
 
 came lo the houle of Mrs. Modely, where the 
 
 ■fiift found that reached the ears of Mifs Betfy^ 
 
 ' were groans,which feemed to ifTue from the mouth 
 
 of a perlbn in the pangs of death. 
 
 Mrs. Modely led her into Sir Frederick's cham- 
 ber, which W3S judicioufly darkned, fb as to leave 
 light enough to difcern objefts, yet not f() much as 
 to render them too perfpicuous :— — Mifs Betfy faw 
 him lying on the bed, as Mrs. Modely defcribed, 
 with a fWord flicking upright in his breaft, — a 
 clergyman, and another perlbn, who appeared to 
 be the furgeon, were fitting near him. — 'Mifs 
 ' Betfy is fo good,' laid Mrs. Modely, * to corne to 
 
 * vifit you, fir Frederick.'— ' I am glad of ir,' re- 
 plied he, with a low voice, — ' pray, madam, ap- 
 ' proach.' 
 
 ' I am forry, fir Frederick, to find you have be«n 
 
 * guilty of fo rafh an aflion,' faid Mifs Betfy, draw- 
 ing towards the^ed.— — ' I could not live without 
 
 * you,' rejoined he, * nor would die without leav- 
 ' ing you as happy as it is in my power to make 
 
 ;'.youj — I hav.e fettled two thoufund pounds a.

 .* had to > true a regard for you ever ro dofire, you

 Mifs Betfy was fo much amazed atthispropofal, 
 
 that /he had not the power to fpeak 5 but Mrs, 
 
 .Modely cried out, ' Was ever any -hing 1-) gene- 
 
 * rous! ' — 'Truly noble indeed,' added the fur- 
 geon, 'and worthy of himfelf, and the love he 
 '|has for this lady.'——' Blefs me ! ' faid Mifs Betfy,

 * ought, fir Frederick, to have other thoughts, as 
 
 * vou are going out of the world.' 
 
 ' Aye, lir Frederick,' cried the parfon, * think 
 
 * of yfuir immortal part.'—* I can think of nothing,' 
 anfweredhe, groaning bitterly, ' of my own hap- 
 
 * pinels, 'till I have fixed that of Mils Betfy's. ■— — 
 
 * Lord, madam,' cried Mrs. Modely, foftly, ' 5011 
 
 * would not be fo mad to refufe: what two 
 
 * thnuland pounds a 3 ear, and a Jadyfliip, with 
 ^ liberty to marry who you will ?' 
 
 ' This is the moft generous offer I ever heard 
 
 * of,' faid the parfon j ' but I wifh the lady would 
 ' refolve foon, for it is high time fir Frederick 
 
 * fliould prepare for another world.'* ' He 
 
 * cannot live above an hour,' rejoined the fiirgeon, 
 
 * even if the fword is not withdrawn ;- ■■ there- 
 
 * fore, good madam, think what you have to do." , 
 
 "V^ hiie they were fpcaking fir Frederick re-' 
 doubled his groans, and they went on preflingher 
 to accept the terms he offered. — ' Do not 
 
 * plunge a man into a fad eternity, merely for his 
 
 * love to you,' faid the parfon. — * All the world 
 
 * would condemn you, fhould you.refufe,' cried 
 the fuigeon. — ' A virgin widow with two thou- 
 
 * land pounds a year,' added Mrs. Modely. 
 
 In this manner did they urge her, and the par- 
 f(>n getting on the one fide of her, and the Ihr- 
 geon on the other, plied her fo clofe with argur 
 ments, both on the advantages accruing to herfelf, 
 and the compaffion owing from her to a gentle- 
 iTjan, who had committed this adl: of defperation 
 on himfejf, meerly through his love of her, that 
 /he neither could^ nor knew how to make any ai;- 
 Iwer, when fir Frederick giving two or three great 
 j^roans, which feemed more deep than before, 
 and the (urgeon pretending to take mifs Betly*s

 the ceremony, — pafs over the prelude, and be- 
 gin at the moft eflfential part, elfe my patient ■ 
 
 * won't live to the conclufion.' 
 
 The parfon knew very well what he had to do, 
 having his book ready, began at——' fir Frede- 
 
 * rick Fineer, baroner, wilt thou have this woman 
 
 * to thy wedded wife ?' — and fo on. — To which 
 fir Frederick anfwered, in the fame difmal accents 
 he had hitherto fpoken, * I will/ ' Then the 
 parfon turning to MiisBetfy, faid, ' BetlyThought- 
 ' Jels, wilt i-hou have this man to be thy wedded 
 
 * husband?' — and fo forth, MiisBetfy ir. the 
 
 confufion of her tiiind, not well knowing what 
 file faid, or did, replied in the affirmative, on 
 which he was hurrying over the reft of the cere- 
 mony, but (lie recollecting herfelf, cried out, —• 
 
 * Hold, doflor, I cannot be married in this man- 
 
 * ner.'— — But he feemed not to regard her words, 
 but read on, and the furgeon taking hold of hear 
 hand, and joining it with fir Frederick's, held it 
 io fpite of her refiftance, 'till the ring was forced 
 upon her finger. 
 
 This adion fo incenfed her, that the inftant (lie 
 got her hand at liberty, Hie plucked off the ring, 
 and threw it on the ground : — — ' What do you 
 
 * mean,' faid fhe ? — « Do you think to compel me 
 
 * to a marriage ?—iModely, you have not ufed 
 
 * me well.'—— With thefe words fhe was turning 
 to go out of the room, but perceived, not till 
 then, that Mrs. Modely had flipped out, and that 
 the door was locked j-— Hie then began to call, 
 
 * Mrs. Modely, — Mis. Modely :' to which no an- 
 fwer was made. 
 
 * Come, come, madam,' faid the furgeon, ' this

 cried the fiirgeon, ' and that we muft leave the 
 ' bridegroom to compleat before he dies.' . 
 With thefe words they both went out, making the 
 door faft after them. 
 
 Mifs Betfy iv.dde ufe of her ufmoft efforts to 
 pafs at the fame time they did, but they piifhed 
 her back with lo much violence, as almoft threw 
 her down, and fir Frederick at the lame time 
 iiiniping off the bed, and throwing away the 
 jword, which fie imagined flieathed in his body^' 
 cafched herfiiddenly in his arms. 
 
 'Tis hard to lay, whether rage for the impofitt-

 xip his fword, and was advancing towards him with 
 thefe words, ' That woman is my wife,' faid he ; 
 
 * how dare any one interfere between us ?' ' O^. 
 
 * 'tis falfe! — 'tis falle ! — - believe him not,' 
 cried Mifs Betfy. — - Her proteflor made no re- 
 ply, but flying at his antagonift, immediately 
 clofed with him, wrenched the fword out of his 
 hand, which, throwing on the ground, he let his- 
 foot upon, and fnapped it in pieces. 
 
 The obfcurity of the room, joined to the es- 
 ceffive agitations Mifs Betfy was in, had, 'till 
 now, hindered her from difcovering, either by 
 the voice or perfon, who it was to whom /lie 
 owed her lafety 3 on his drawing back one of the 
 window curtains to give more light into the place, 
 that he might fee with whom he had been en^ 
 gaged, /he prefently faw, to her great amazement 
 and confufion, that her deliverer was no other than . 
 Mr. Trueworth. 
 
 But how great foever was her alloninimentj 
 that of Mr. Trueworth was not lels, when looking 
 on the face of the pretended lir Frederick Fineer, 
 he prefently knew hmi to be a fellow, who had 
 ferved in quality of valet de chambre to a gentle- 
 man he was acquainted v;ith in France, who had 
 robbed his matter, and only through his lenity and 
 compaffion had avoided the puniihment his crimes 
 de ferved.

 ' Rafcal !' cried Mr, Trueworth, ' have you e- 
 * fcaped breaking on the wheel at Paris, to attempt 
 ^ deeds more deferving death in England. '— The- 
 wretch, who hitherto had behaved with a very 
 lofty air, now finding he was difcovered, fell at 
 Mr. Trueworth's feet, and begged he would have 
 mercy on him j — — alledged, that what he had 
 done was occafioned by mere neceffity j — — faid, 
 he was told the lady had a great fortune, and' 
 might be eafily gained, and ftich like ituff, which 
 putting Mr. Trueworth beyond all patience, he- 
 gave him three or four blows with the flat of his 
 f'word, before he fliearhed it, faying at the fame- 
 time, ' Execrable dog ! — — if thou wert not un- 
 
 * worthy of death from any hand but that of the 
 
 * common hangman, thou fhouldfl not live a mo- 
 
 * ment to boaft the lealt acquaintance with this

 was half dying with the various emotions flie was- 
 pofleiTed of: — — • ' Madam,' laid he, ' I will not 
 " ailc by what means you came into this villain's 
 ' company, only permit me to cundu(5^ you hence,- 
 ' and lee you fafely home.' 
 
 Mils Betfy was feized with fo violent a fit oF 
 trembling through all her fran>e, that /he had- 
 neither voice to thank him, for the extraordinary 
 aiTiftance flie had received from him, nor ftrengtiT 
 enough to bear her down flairs, if he had not 
 with the greateft politenefs and mofl tender care, 
 fupporied her at every flep /he took. 
 
 They found no creature below^ the houfe 
 feemed as if forfaken by all its inhabitants ; but 
 the parlour door being open, Mr. True won h 
 placed his fair charge in an e.iiy chair, uhile he 
 ran to find foniebody to get a coach. 
 
 After much knocking and calling, Mrs. Modely

 Beify was. » ... — - As loon as tiiat young lady dw

 her, ' Oh, Mrs. Modely,' cried fhe, * I could not

 ' this cruel manner.' — — * Blels me ! madam,' 
 replied fhe, in a confufion, which /he in vain 
 endeavoured to conceal ; • ■ ■ * I kaow not what

 * nothing has happened to my dear Mils JBcrly.'' 
 ' — — Whatever has. happened,' laid Mr. I'rue- 
 worth, fiercely, 'will be inquired intoj— — in 
 
 ' the mean time, all we require of you is to fend' 
 ' fomebody for a coach.' 
 
 Mrs. Modely then ringing a bell, a maid fer- 
 , v^nt appeared, and what Mr. Trueworth had le- 
 ' q-uefted was immediately performed j but, though 
 Mils Betiy now law herfelf Ikfe from the milchief 
 which had 'io lately threatened her, /lie had ftill* 
 (?motions very terrible to fuftain, and would have, 
 doubtlefs, thrown- her into a fw'oon, if not vented- 
 in a violent l^ood of tears. 
 
 Being arri'^jed at-thehoufe where Mifs Bet/y

 her.

 her, might well occafion odd fort ofapprehenfions 
 in both the brothers, efpecially in the younger. 
 
 The fudden fight of her brothers,made a frefli at- 
 tack on the already fo much weakened fpirits of Mifs 
 Betfy, and /he would have funk on the threfliold 
 of the door, as Mr. Trueworth quitted her hand 
 in order to prefent it to Mr. Francis, if the elder 
 Mr. Thoughtlefs, feeing her totter, had not that 
 inftant catched her in his arms. 
 
 * Confufion !' cried Mr, Francis, * what does all 
 ' this mean ? — Trueworth is it thus you bring 
 
 * my filler home ?'— — ' I am heartily forry for 
 
 * the occafion,'— faid Mr. Trueworth, ' fince' — 
 he was going on, but Mr. Francis, fired with a 
 miftaken rage.prevented him,crying out, ' 'Sdeath, 
 ' fir, how came you with my fifter ?'— — Mr. True- 
 worth, a little provoked to find the fervice he had 
 done fo ill requited, replied in a difdainful tone, 
 
 * /lie will inform you, — after that, if you have 
 
 * any farther demands upon me, you know where 
 
 * I am to be found 5—- I have no leifqre now to 
 
 * anfwer your interrogatories.' 
 
 With thefe words he flepped hallily into the 
 coach, and ordered to be drove to the two red 
 lamps in Golden Square. 
 
 Mifs Betfy *s lenies were entirely loft for fome 
 moments, fo that /he knew nothing of what had 
 pafled: — Mr. Francis hearing what direflions 
 Mr. Trueworth had given the coachman, was for 
 following and forcing him to an explanation, but 
 the elder Mr. Thoughtlefs prevailed on him to 
 ftay till they fhould hear what their fifter would 
 lay on this affair. 
 
 She was carried into her apartment, rather dead 
 than alive, but being laid on a fettce, and proper 
 means applied, (lie foon returned to a condition 
 capable of fatisfying their curiofity.

 MISS Betfy having her heart and head full of 
 the obli^arion /he had to Mr. Ti ueworth, 
 and on the firft recovery of her fenfes, thinking he 
 was ftill near her, cried our,— »'Ohl Mr True- 
 ' worth, how /hall I thank the goodnefs you have 
 ' fliewn me !— — I have no words to do it,— it is 
 
 * from my brothers you mud receive thole demon- 
 
 * ftrations of gratitude, which are not in my pow- 
 ' er to give.' 
 
 The brothers looked fonietinies on her, and 
 fometimes o\\ each other, with a good deal of lur- 
 pril'e aJ] the time flie was I'peaking, 'till perceiving 
 ihe had done,— — ' To whom are you talking, {if- 
 
 * ter ?' I'iid Mr. Francis, * here 25 no body but my 
 
 * brother and myfelf.' 
 
 Blefs me !' cried file, looking round the room, 
 
 * how wild my head is! — I knew not where I 
 
 * was, I thought mylelf liill in the houfe of 
 
 * that wicked woman that betrayed me, and faw 
 
 * my generous deliverer chaftifing the monfter 
 
 * that attempted my deltrufbion.' 
 
 * Who was that monfter ?' demanded the elder 
 Mr. Thoughtleis, haftily. — — * A villain with- 
 
 * out a name,' faid (he, ' for that of fir Frederick 
 ' Fineer was but afTumed, to hide a common cheat ! 
 
 * "—a robber !'■ — - ' And who, fay you,' rejoined 
 Mr. Francis, ' was your deliverer?' ' Who, but 
 
 * that belt of men 1' anfwered (he, ' Mr. True- 
 
 * worth ! — — O, brothers, it you have any regard 
 
 * for me, or for the honour of our family, you 
 ' can never too much revere, or love the honour, 
 ^ ind the virtue of that worthy man.' 
 
 * You fee, Frank, how greatly you have been 
 '*.to blanje,' faid the elder Mr. Thoughtlefs,, 
 
 and

rso ri'^ HISTORY of 
 
 * and how much more fo you mij^ht have been, 
 ' if I had not diffiiaded you from following that 
 
 * gentleman, who, I now perceive, was the fa- 
 
 * viour, not the invader of our lifter's innocence.* 
 *— ' I blulh,' replied Mr. Francis, 'at the re- 
 
 * membrarice of my raflmefs, — I ought, indeed, 
 
 * to have known Trueworth better.' 
 
 There pafled no more between them on this 
 fuhjedt, but on finding Mifs Betfy grew more 
 comjioled, and able to continue a converlation, 
 they obliged her to repeat the particulars of what 
 had happened to her, which flie accordingly did, 
 with the greateft veracity imaginable, omittmg 
 nothing of moment in the fliocking narrative. 
 
 The calling to mind a circumftance lb detefl- 
 abie to her natural delicacy, threw her, however, 
 into fuch agonies, which made diem think it their 
 province, rather to confole lier under the afBifti- 
 on Ihe had fufl:ainsd, than to chide her for the in- 
 advertency that had brought it on her. 
 
 They ftayed fupper wich her, which, to fave 
 hej: the trouble of ordering, Mr. Thought lefs 
 went to an adjacent tavern, and gave diredions 
 for it himfelf, — made her drink feveral glafles 
 of wine, and both of them did every thing in 
 their power tochear and reftore her fpirits to their , 
 former tone, after which they retired and left her'' 
 to enjoy what repole the prelent anxieties of het * 
 mind would permit her to take. 
 
 Though the condition Mils Betfy was in, made 
 thefe gentlemen treat her with the abovementi- 
 oned tenderneft, yet both of them were highly 
 incenfed againft her, for fo unadvifedly encou- 
 raging the pretenfions of a man, whole charafler 
 Jhe knew n-ithing of, but from the mouth of a 
 little mantua- maker ;—- her confenting to fup 
 with him at the houle of that woman, and after- 
 wards running with her into his very bed-chamber, 
 
 were

 were aftions, which to them feemed to have no 
 excufe. 
 
 Mr. Francis, as of the two having the tnofl ten- 
 der afifeflion for her, had the moft deep concern 
 in whatever related to her : — If fhe were either 
 ' a fool,' laid he, llamping with exrremitj' of 
 vejc^tion, ' or of a vicious inclination, her con- 
 
 * duEt would leave no room tor v;(jnder ;— — but 
 ' for a girl, who wants neither wit nor virtue, to 
 
 * expoie herlelf in this manner, has fomething in 
 ' it inconfiitent ! — unnatural ! — mondrous !' 
 
 ' I doubt not,' cried he agiim, ' if the truth 
 
 * could he known, that it was fome lu.'h ridicu- 
 ■' lous adventure as this, that loft her the affedion 
 ' of Mr. Trueworth, though her pride and his ho- 
 ' nour joined to conceal it,' 
 
 The elder Mr. Thoughtlefs was entirely of his 
 brother^s opinion in all thefe points, and both of 
 them now were more confirmed than ever, that 
 marriage was the only fure guard for the reputation 
 of a young woman of their fifter's temper. — -Mr. 
 Munden had been there the day before, and, as 
 he had told Mils Betly he would do, declared 
 hfthfelf to them j fb it was refolved between 
 them, that if on proper enquiry, his circum- 
 ftances fhould be found iuch as he laid they were, 
 to clap up the wedding with all imaginable ex- 
 pedition. 
 
 Buf no bufinefs, how important or perplexincr 
 foeverit may be, can render gratitude and good- 
 manners forgotten, or negletrled by perlons of un- 
 derftanding and politenels 5 thefe gentlemen 
 thought a vifir to Mr. Trueworth neither could 
 nor ought to be difpenfed with, in order to make 
 him thole acknowledgements the fervice he had 
 done their iiirer demanded from them, 
 
 Accordingly, the next morning Mr. Thought- 
 lefs, accompanied by his bfother, went in his own 
 
 coach.

 to vifir. 
 
 They found Mr. Trueworth at home, who, 
 doiihtlefs, was not without lome expectation of 
 their coming ^ — on iheir fending up rheir names, 
 he received tliem at the top of the Hair cafe with 
 fo graceful an aff.biluy, and fweeinels in his air, 
 as convinced the elder Mr. Thoughtiefs, that the 
 high chirafler his brother Frank had given of that 
 gentleman, was far from exceeding^ the bounds of 
 truth. 
 
 It is certain, indeed, that Mr. Trueworth, fince 
 the eclairciflement of the Denham affiir, had felt 
 the fevereft remorle within himfelf, for having 
 given credit to that wicked alperfion call upon 
 Mils Betly, and the reflexion, that fortune had 
 now put it in his power to attone for the wrong 
 he had been guilty of to that lady, by the late 
 fervice he had done her, gave a fecret fatisfaction 
 to his mind, that diffuted itlelt through all his 
 air, and gave a double (prightlinefs to thofe eyes, 
 which, by the report of all whoever law him, 
 flood in need of no addition to their lullre. 
 
 The elder Mr. Thoughtiefs having made his 
 compliments <-n the occafion, which had brought 
 him thither, the younger advanced, though with a 
 look fomewhat more dowiicalt than ordinary : — 
 
 * I kr< w not, fir,' laid he, ' whether any tefti- 
 
 * monies of the gratitude I owe you will be ac- 
 
 * ceptable, after the folly into which a mirtaken 
 
 * ragejtianlported me hill: night.'—' Dear Frank,' 
 cried Mr. Trueworth, Imilino, and giving him his 
 hand, in token of a perfefl reconciliation, ' none 
 ' of thele formal fpeeches, — we know each other, 
 
 * — you are by nature warm, rind the little phi-

 , ... < Dear Triieworth,' replied the other, em- 
 bracing him, ' you are born every way to over- 
 
 * come.' 
 
 Mr. Thoughtlefs returning to feme expreflions 
 :of his fenle of the obligation he had conferred 
 iipon their whole family :— — ' Sir, I have done 
 
 * no more,' laid Mr. Truoworth, ' than what eve- 
 ' ry man of honour would think himfelf bound to 
 
 * do for any woman in the like diftrefs, much more 
 / for a lady io deferving as Mifs Betfy Thoughtlefs.

 * which my good liars condu6led me to the reicue 
 
 * of her innocence among the mod fortunate ones 
 
 * of my whole life.' 
 
 In the courfe of theirconverfation, the brothers 
 
 -.fatisfied Mr. Trueworth's curiofiry, by acqi.iaint- 
 
 jng him with the means by which their fifter had 
 
 been fediieed into the danger he had fo happily 
 
 delivered her from, and Mr. Triieworth in his 
 
 turn, informed them of the accident that had £b 
 
 jfeafonably brought him to her relief; which 
 
 'Jatter, as the reader is yet ignorant of, 'tis proper 
 
 ,'iifhould be related. 
 
 ' Having ient,' iiiid he, * for my Heward te

 After this mutual recapitulation, the two bro- 
 thers began to confider what was to be done for

 him by law would expofe their fifter's folly, and 
 prove the moft mortal ftab that could be given to

 By this time they were at Mrs. Modely's door f

 the lodgings, becaufe Ihe had fuffered him to be 
 interrupted in them 3 — and that /he was :fick in 
 bed with the fii<»ht of what had happened, and 
 could not be Ipoke to. 
 
 On this Mr. True worth ran up to his Reward's 
 chamber, n(;t doubting but he (hould there be cer- 
 tainly informed whetlier the rnock baronet was 
 j^one or not j — the two Mr. Thoughtlefles waited 
 in the parlour till his return, which was immedi- 
 ately, with intelligence, that the wretch had left 
 the houfe loon after bit«felf had condu<3cd Mils 
 Betfy thence. 
 
 They had now no loftger any bufinefi here ; but 
 the elder Mr. Thoughtlels could not take leave 
 of Mr. Trucworth without entreating the favour 
 of feeing him at his houfe : to which he replyed, 
 that he believed he Ihould not ftay long in town, 
 and while he did fo, had biifinels that very much 
 engrofled his tiine, but at his return (hould rejoice 
 in an opportunity of cultivating afriendlhip with

 This was a ftrange phcenomenon to Mr. True-

 The impatience Mr. Trueworth was in, for 
 the full explanation of a myftery, which, perhaps, 
 he had fbme guefs into the truth of, hindered 
 him from making any anfwer to what Mifs Harriot

 How would the vain, unthinking fop, have 
 exulted on fuch a proof of his imagined merit ? 
 — — how would the Ibrdid avaricious man, in the 
 pleafure of finding fo unexpefled an acceflion to 
 his wealth, have forgot all companion for the

 contrary, bluOied at having fo much more a/cribed 
 to him, than he would allow himfelf to think he 
 deferved, and would gladly have been deprived 
 of the beft part of his fortune, rather than have 
 received an addition to it by fuch fatal means.' 
 
 The accident, however, was fo ailoni/hing to 
 him, that he fcarce believed it real, nor C( uld 
 what he read in the letter, under her own hand,

 Mr. Trueworth, whofe modefty had been fuf- 
 ficiently wounded in this converlation, haftiJy re- 
 plied, ' Madam, what you by an excefs of good- 
 nefs are pleafed to call generofity, was, in effecV, 
 no more then a piece of common honefty : — the

 his neighbour of thecafii intruded in his hands : 
 — the unfortunate Mrs. BlanchfieJd did me 
 the honour to depend on my finceriry and fecre- 
 cy ; — I did but my duty in obferving both, — 
 and fhe in fa- highly over-rating that a6l of 
 duty, fhewed indeed the magnanimity of her 
 own mind, but adds no merit to mine.'

 re fumed flie, 'I could almofl wifli, that you were 
 
 * a little lefs delerving than you are, fince the e- 
 
 * fteem yoH enforce is of fo dangerous a kind.'— 
 She uttered this with fb inexpreflible a tendernels 
 in her voice and eyes, that he could not reftrain 
 himfelf from kiffing her hand in the moll pafli- 
 onate manner, though in the prefence of her bro- 
 ther and fifter, crying,, at the fame time, ' I de-

 They afterwards fell into fome difcourfe, con-

 and what was io only in appearance, in which 
 many miftakes in judging were detefted, and the 
 (extreme weaknefs of giving implicirly into the opi^-

 into her hands 5—— at firlt, fhe thought of going-

 Sleep was no lefif a /^ anger to her eyes this

 which kept her waking:-— -in the firft, the 
 Ihock of the infult /he had luliained, and the 
 fhame of her receiving her protetlilion honi hinr», 
 by wliom, of all men living, Hie was leafl wil- 
 ling to be obliged, took up all her thoughts — — in 
 the fecond, fhe was equally engrofled by the iin- 
 patitnce of having fomething to preierve him 
 eternally in her mind. 
 
 After long revolving within herfelf, /he at 
 Idft hit upon the means of accomplilhing her de- 
 fires ; — — the rilque fhe ran, indeed, was fome- 
 what bold, bur as it fucceeded without fufpicion, 
 /he had only to guard againft accidents, that might 
 occalion a future difcovery of what /he had doiie. 
 
 • Early the next morning Aie fent to Blunt's, — ► 
 hired a handfome chaife and pair, with a coach-

 be pretty confident, that when he Ihould come to 
 examine who had taken away, his pi\5iure, the de- 
 I'cription could never enable him to guefs at the 
 right per/on. 
 
 With this equipage /he went to the houfe 
 where the painter lived j — on enquiring for him 
 by his name, he came immediately to know her 
 commands.— ' You have the pidiure here of Mr.

 * Hampftead laft night, and being to follow hini 
 'this morning, he defired I would bring it with 
 
 * me, and pay you the money.*- — ' O, madam, 
 ' as to the money,' laid he, ' I Tnall fee Mr. True-

 bring down his pidure. ' Indeed I /hall not

 ••how much is it ?' — — . ' My conftant price, ma- 
 ' dam,' replied he, ' is ten guineas, and the gen- 
 ' tliman never offered to beat me down.' 
 
 By this time the man had brought the pidlure 
 down in a little box, which the painter opening, 
 as he prefented to her, cried, ' Is it not a prodigi- 
 
 ' ous likenels, madam?'' 'Yes, really, fir,' 
 
 faid /he, ' in my opinion there is no fault to be

 pocket, — counted ten guineas to him out of her 
 purie, and told him, with a ffnile, that flie be- 
 lieved he would very /hortly have more bulinefs 
 from the lanie^quarter, — then bid the coachman 
 drive on. 
 
 The coachman having previous orders wh.it to 
 do, was no fooner out ot fight of the painter's 
 boufe, than he turned down the fiift Itreer, and 
 carried Mifs Betty diredly home;— /lie dif- 
 charged her retinue, undreffed herfelf with ail 
 the Ipeed /he could, and whoever had now leen 
 her, would never have fufpefled jhe had been

 MISS Betfy was not deceived in her conjee-^ 
 tiire, in relation to the piflure's being de- 
 signed as an offering to fome lady : — Mr. True- 
 worth had not indeed fat for it to pleafe himfelf, 
 but to oblige Mifs Harriot, who had given fome 
 hints, that fuch a prefent would not be unwelcome 
 to her. 
 
 It is a common thing with painters to keep the 
 pieces in their own hands as long as they can, 
 after they are finifhed, (^fpecially if they are of 
 perfons endued by nature with any perleftions, 
 which may do honour to their art : — this gentle- 
 man was like others of his profeffion, — he found

 wanting in the drapery. 
 
 Mr. Trueworrh growing a little impatient at the 
 delay, as Mifs Harriot had afked two or three 
 times, in a gay manner, when Hie (hould lee his 
 relemblance, went hifnfelF, in order to fetch it 
 away : — the painter was iiirprifed at fight of 
 him, and much more lo when he dem:inded the 
 pii5ture ; — — he told him, however, the whole 
 truth without hefiration, that he delivered it to a 
 lady not above an hour before he came, who paid 
 him the rnoney for ir, and (.iid that Ihe had Cftiied 
 for ir on his requeft. 
 
 Nothing had ever happened that Teemed more

 thing, which, perhaps, would ha've givcii her 
 more lafting confufion, than even her late unhrcky 
 a<lvenuire wiih the mock baroner. 
 
 She was, however, among all the ladies of his 
 acquaintance, almoft the only one who tiever came 
 info his head on this occafion ; — ibmetimes he 
 thought of one,— fometimes he thought of ano- 
 thei' j but on recollcdling all the particulirs of 
 their behaviour towards him, could find no rea- 
 fon toalcribe what had been done to any of them :

 gine capable of luch a thing j -— he found it high-

 tther piflure, yet he could not be angry with the 
 'woman who had occafioned it:— on the con- 
 ftrary, he thought there was (bmethina ih tender, 
 sand fo delicate withal, in this proof of her paffi- 
 (on, th:u it very much enhanced the pity and good- 
 ! .will he before had for her. 
 
 Butr while his generous heart was entertaining 
 
 1 thele too favourable and kind lentiments of her, 
 
 fhe v;as employing her whole wicked wir, to 
 
 make him appear the baled of mankind, and alfo 
 
 to render him the mofl unhappy. 
 
 She had found out every thing fhe wanted to 
 know, concerning Mr. Truewortli's courtfhip to 
 Jvjils Harriot, and flattered hericif, that a Jady 
 bred in the country, and unacquainted with the 
 artifices frequently praftifed in town, to blacken 
 the fairelb charafters, would eaflly be frighted in- 
 to a belief ot any thing fhe attempted to infpire 
 her with. 
 
 In the vile hope, therefore, of accompli filing 
 fo deteftable a projefl, /he contrived a letter in 
 the following terms : 
 
 To Mifs Harriot Loveit.

 Mifs Flora, on considering what (lie hid wrote, 
 began to think fhe had exprt;fled herlblf in Ibmc- 
 what too warm a manner ; -*- but flie let it pals 
 on this account :— -' By the virulence,' laid (he, 
 ' with which I have fpoke of Trueworth, his

 ' neverthelefs v./ill believe others to be faft, and

 She therefore went to the perlon, who was al- 
 ways her iecretary in af&irs of this nature, and- 
 having got it copied, was going to rhe poit-houfe^ 
 in order to (end it away j for Ihe never trufted

 turning the corner of another ftreet. 
 
 * Oh, Mr. Trueworth,' cried fhe, as they drew 
 near each other, ' I have prayed that I might live,

 Mr, Trueworth had not been very well pleafed

 time upon his bofom, crying, —'Oh, True- 
 ' worth ! ■ — Tnieworth ! — here let me die, for 
 
 * death has nothing in it fb terrible as the being 
 
 * feparated from you.' 
 
 Mr. Trueworth was a man of ftri61: honour,-^ 
 great refolution, and paffionately devoted to the 
 moft delervingof her lex j — — yet he was ftill a 
 man, ——was of an amorous compleflion, and 
 thus tempted, who can anl'wer, but in this un- 
 guarded moment he might have been guilty of a 
 wrong to his dear Harriot, for which he would 
 afterwards have hated himfelf, if an accident of 
 more lervice to him, than his owjj virtue, in fb 
 critical a junt5ture, had not prevented him ? 
 
 He ri.*;urned the embrace /he gave, and joined 
 his lips to hers, with a warmth which flie had 
 not for a long time experienced from him, a 
 fiidden rufli of tranfport came at once upon her, 
 with fuch force, that it overwhelmed her fpiiits-, 
 and fhe fell into a kind of fainting between his 
 arms j— -he was frighted at the change he ob- 
 ferved in her, and haftily cutting the lacings of 
 her Hays to give her air, the letter above-mentioned 
 dropped from her breall upon the ground : — he 
 took it up, and was going to throw it upon the 
 table, but in that aftion leeing the name of Mifs 
 Harriot on the fuperfcription, was (truck with 
 
 an aflonifhment not eafy to be conceived 5 he 
 
 no longer thought of the condition Mifs Flora was 
 in, but tearing open the letter began to examine 
 the contents. 
 
 Mils Flora in that inflant recovering her fenfcs, 
 and the remembrance of what had been concealed 
 inherbolbm, flew to him, endeavouring to fiiatch 
 the paper from his hands, but he had already feen

 too much not to be determined to fee the reft. — 
 
 * Stand off!' cried he, in a voice half choaked with 
 fury, — — ' I am not yet fully acquainted with the 
 'whole of the favours you have beiiuwed upon 
 
 * me in this paper.' — Confounded as fhe was, 
 Cunning did not quite forfake her,— — ' I am ig- 
 
 * nerant of what it contains,' laid (he;——' I 
 
 * found it in the ftreet. — It is not mine, 1 
 
 * wrote it not.* 
 
 With fuch like vain pretences would fhe have 
 pleaded innocence, yet all the time endeavoured, 
 with her whole ftrength, to force the proof of her 
 guilt from him, infomuch that though he was ve- 
 ry tall, he was obliged with one hand to keep her 
 off, and with the other hold the paper at arms 
 length, while he was reading it, yet could not 
 forbear frequently interrupting himfelf, to cafl a 
 look full of contempt and rage, on the malicious 
 authorels,— — ' Vile hypocrite!' cried he ;-*- and 
 then again, as he got farther into thebafe inveclive,. 
 ' — Thou fiend in female form !' 
 
 She now finding all was over, and feis^ed with 
 a fudden fit of frenzy, or fomething like it, ran to 
 his fword, which he had pulled off, and laid in* 
 the window, and was about to plunge it in her 
 breaft ; — he eafily wielted it from her, and put- 
 ing it by his fide, ' O thou ferpent! — thou vi- 
 per I' cried he, ^' if thou wert a man, thou 
 ' /houldfl not need to be thy own executioner.'-* 
 The tide of her paflion then turning another way, 
 file threw herfeif at his feet, ——clung round his 
 legs, and in a voice rather fcreaming than fpeak- 
 ing uttered thefe words: * O, pardon me !- ■— 
 
 ' piry me ! whatever I have done my love of 
 
 ' yuu occafioned it.' — — ' Curfe on fuch poifonous

 On hearing thefe dreadful words, all her' 
 ftrength forlbok her, — the finews of her hands* 
 relaxed, and loft their grafp, — flie fell a fecond 
 time into a fainting fir, but of a nature as diflferent- 
 from what the former had been, as were the emo-

 now too much and too juftly irritated to be capable- 
 of relenting 5 —— he left her in this condition, and . 
 only bid the people at the bar, as he went out of. 
 the houfe, fend fomebody up to her affiftance.

 him altogether unfit for company, he went di-

 with more attention than he could do before, he 
 prefently imagined, he was not altogether unac-

 knew it was not that of Mifs Flora, yet pofitive

 MISS Betfy was all this time enjoying the linle 
 fraud fhehad been guihy of :—— the idea- 
 how Mr. Trueworth would be lurprized at finding 
 his picture had been taken away, and the various 
 conjeftures that would naturally riie in his mind, 
 upon fb odd an accident, gave her more real 
 pleafure than others feel on the accompliihraent 
 of the mofl. materia] event. 
 
 She was, indeed, of a humour the moft per- 
 fed^iy happy for herfelf that could be j— chear- 
 1 ful, — gay, — not apt to create imaginary ills, as 
 ! too many do, and become wretched for misfor- 
 tunes which have no exiftence, but in their own 
 ! fretful difpofitions. • On any real caufe, either 
 I for grief or anger, that happened to her, no body, 
 iit is certain, felt them with a more poignant fen- 
 ifibility j but then Hie was affected with them but 
 ; a fliort time.— —The turbulent paffions could 
 ■ obtain no refidence in her mind, and on the firft 
 approaches of their oppofite emotions entirely 
 vaniflied, as if they had never been. — — The ar- 
 I rows of affliction, of what kind foever they 
 / were, but flightly glanced upon her heart, not 
 ipiercedit, much lels were able to make any lafi:- 
 ling impreffion there. 
 
 She now viiited as ufual, — faw as much com- 
 jpany as ever, and hearing no mention made, 
 "wherever rtie went, of her adventure with the 
 I mock baronet, concluded, the whole thing was, 
 and would remain, an eternal fecrer, and there- 
 fore eafily forgot it 5 or, if it came into her head, 
 remembered it only on account of her deliverer. 
 She was now on exceeding good terms with 
 her brothers, who were full of fpirits themfelves :

i:64 "The HISTORY of 
 
 — ' ' • the elder Mr. Thoiightlefs, who loved play 
 but too well, had lately had feme lucky carts, and 
 Mr. Francis had accompiilhed his affairs, — his 
 coniniiffion was figned, and every thing contri- 
 buted to render the whole family perfeflly eafy 
 in themfelves, and obliging to each other. ' 
 
 In the midft of this contentment of mind Mr. 
 Edward Goodman came to town from Deal : — — 
 the two Mr. Thoughtlefles, on account of the 
 many obligations they had to his uncle, and the 
 good charafler they had heard of himfelf, re- 
 ceived him with abundance of refpeit and affec- 
 tion. 
 
 This young Indian had a great deal of the ho- 
 neft fimplicity of his uncle, both in his counte- 
 nance and behaviour, and wanted not politenefs 
 and good manners fufficient to render his conver- 
 lation very agreeable. 
 
 He was fent from Bengal at about four years of 
 age, and received the fifft rudiments of his educa- 
 tion at one of the bell fchools in England, where 
 he continued till he had attained to his nineteenth, 
 and then returned to his native country, and was 
 now about twenty- four. 
 
 Mr. Thoughtkft; had now got fo much the bet- 
 ter of his milliels, as to prevail on her, to con- 
 tent herfelf with keeping in her own apartment, 
 whenever he had any company, by whom it was 
 improper for her to be feen. 
 
 He made a handfome entertainment for Mr. 
 Goodman, loon after his arrival, to which the 
 lawyer, who had the care of his affairs, with his 
 wife, a well bred, difcreet woman, was alfo in- 
 vited 3 — Mils Betly, at the requeft of her bro- 
 ther, prefided at the head of the table. 
 
 Dinner was ordered to be ready about three, 
 and the invitation accordingly made 3 but the 
 lawyer not coming, his wife, perceiving they 
 
 v/aited

 waited for him, was a little perplexed ; but fhe 
 was foon eaiedjjf it, by his coming in lefs than 
 a qiarter of an hour, after the time he was ex- 
 pected. 
 
 This gentleman was the very perfon who made 
 Mrs. Blanchf;elu'6 will, and to apologize for his 
 ftay, he reUted to them the caiife th.^r had detain-- 
 ed him, which was, that a demur being made tc* 
 the p.iyment ot Ibme part of the money bequeath- 
 ed by that lady to Mr. Trueworthy he had been 
 obliged to go wirh him, in order to reiliFy the 
 rnilTake which had occaHoned it.— —In giving 
 this account he imagined nor, that any perfijfi 
 p'.efent had the leait concern in it, or even were 
 acquainted wirh either o£ the parties he menti- 
 oned. 
 
 Mifs Betfy faid nothings but had her own reflec- 
 tions on what he had been faying 3 /he, how- 
 ever, had the fatisfac^ion of hearing her two 
 brothers aflc thofe queftions fhe longed to put to 
 him herfelf. — — By the aniwers he made, /lie 
 doubted not, but the deceafed had been courted 
 by Mr. Trueworth, — had loved him, and was 
 to have been married to him, by her having made 
 him fo confiderable a legacy. 
 
 The reft of their converiation that whole day, 
 was chiefly on matters concerning the late Mr. 
 Goodman, — the bafenefs of lady Meilafin, and 
 the meafures that were taking to deie^^ the fraud 
 /he had been guilty of 5 — all which was very 
 dry and infipid to Mifs Betly at this time, as in- 
 deed it would have been, had it turned on any 
 other fubjecf. — «• She was not, therefore, very 
 forry when the company broke up, that fhe might 
 be at home, and at full liberty to indulge medita- 
 tions, which promifed her more iatisfaction than 
 any thing Hie could hear abro:id. 
 
 She 
 

<#PG# 174>
lU nt HISTORY of 
 
 She had let it' down in her mind, from what 
 the lawyer had iaid, as a fure fa6V, that Mr. 
 True worth, iince his defifting his courtftiip to her, 
 had loved another, and alio, that her rival in his 
 affeftion was now no more.—* He need not,' 
 ' faid fhe to herfelf, ' be at the trouble of fitting 
 
 * the fecond iime for his pi^^ure, in compliment 
 
 * to her ^ nor can what I have done be a fubjedl 
 ' of dilquiet to either of them.' 
 
 She then would take his piflure out of the ca- 
 binet where Ihe had concealed it, and examine it 
 attentively : — — ' Good God !' cried flie^ ' how 
 uncertain is the heart of man ?— How little de- 
 pendance ought we to place on all the profeffions 
 
 of love they make us ? — JufI: io he looked, 
 
 with all this tendernels in his eyes, when his 
 falfe tongue protefted, he never could think of 
 
 marrying any woman but myfelf.' But thefe 
 
 ineafy, and indeed unjuft reflections, lafled not 
 above a minute : — — •' Mrs. Blanchfield,' laid Ihe, 
 
 had a large fortune j it was that perhaps he 
 
 was in love with, and finding no hope of gain- 
 ing me, he might be tempted by his ambition to 
 
 make his addrelTes to her; but whatever 
 
 were his thoughts on her account, Ihe is now 
 dead J and who knows what may happen ? 
 
 that he once loved me is certain 5 — if he Ihould 
 return to his firft vows, the obligation I have re- 
 ceived from him would not permit me to trent 
 him with the fame iudifference I have done, — I 
 am not in love with any man, continued flie ; 
 buf, if I ever marry, he certainly, exclufive of 
 what he has done for me, delerves in every re- 
 Ipedi the preference, and I (lioidd with lefs re- 
 gret f.ibmit to the yoke of wedlock with him, 
 than any other I have feen.' 
 Thus went Ihe on, forming ideal profpeds all 
 that night, and part of the enfuing day, when the 
 
 elder 
 

<#PG# 175>

 elder Mr. Thougbtlefs came, and gave her the 
 molt unwelcome interruption Hie could receive. 
 
 He told her, that he had jnft received an ac- 
 count to his entire latisfaftion in every thing, re- 
 lating to Mr. Munden, and that no reafonable ob- 
 jeclion could be made, either as to the family,— 
 the ertate, or the charafier of that gentleman 5 
 — — ' Therefore,' faid he, ' as you have thought 
 
 * fit to encourage his pretentions, and he has con- 
 ' tinued them a iufficient kngth of time, to de- 
 
 * fend you from the cenfure of a too quick con- 
 
 * fent, you cannot, l think, in honour, but reward 
 
 * his paflion wirhout delay.' 
 
 Mils Bttfy was, at prelent, in adilpoilrion very 
 unfit to comply with her brother's advice 5 but 
 after all that had been urged by him, and by Mr. 
 Francis, flie could not afTume courage wholly to 
 refufe. 
 
 She hefitated, "— flie began a fentence without 
 ending it, ——and when ihe did, heranfwers were 
 not at all of a piece with that ready wit which 
 ihe had always teftified on other occafions. 
 
 Mr. Thougbtlefs perceiving The was rather (lu- 
 dious to evade giving any determinate anfwer, 
 than willing to give luch a one as he defired flie 
 Hiould, began to expoftulate with her on the ca- 
 pricioufnefs of her humour and behaviour j —— he 
 conjured her to reflefl: on her late adventure with 
 the impoftor, fir Frederick Fineer- and how ill it 
 became her to countenance the addreiles of a 
 wretch like him, and at the fame time trifle with 
 a man of fortune and reputation. 
 
 She fufFe;ed him to go on in this manner for a 
 
 confideral">]e time, without giving him the leafl: 
 
 interruption, but by degrees recovering heripirits, 
 
 — — ' I Ihali take care, fir,' faid Die, ' never to 
 
 '* fall into the like adventure again, neither do I

 * is:i thing of too ferious a nature to hurry it^to^ 
 ' without firft having made trial of the conllancy 
 'of the man who would be a husband, and alio 
 
 * of being well affiired of one's own heart.' 
 
 Mr. Thoughtlefs then told her, with fome 
 warmth, thit he found fhe was relapfing into a 
 humour, and way cf thinking, which could not 
 in the end but bring ruin on herfelf, and difgrace 
 to all her family 5 and added, that for his parr he 
 fliould intermeddle no more in her affairs. — The 
 tender foul of mifs BctVy was deeply affefted at 
 thefe words 5— Hie loved her brothers, and could 
 not bear their difpleafuresj — the thought of 
 having any difagreement with them was dreadful 
 to her, yet the putting a conftraint on her inclina- 
 tions to oblige them was no lefs fo: — in this 
 dilemma, whether ihe complied, or whether fhe 
 refufed, fhe found herfelf equally unhappy. 
 
 One moment Ihe was opening her mouth to 
 yield a ready aiTent to all that was requefted of 
 her, on the fcore of Mr. Munden 5 — the next 
 to confefs, that fhe neither liked, nor loved that 
 gentleman, and knew not whether (]\e jhould 
 ever be able to refolve on a marriage uiih him 5 
 but her fincerity forbad the one, and her fears of 
 offending gave a check to the other, atid both to- 
 gether kept her entirely filent, 
 
 ' You ought, 2Bethinks, however,' refumed 
 
 Mr. Thoughtiels, * to have {pared Mr. Munden 
 
 the trouble of laythf^ open his circumftances, and 
 
 me that of examining into them.'- ' 1 fliould 
 
 un.doubtediy have done fo, fir,' aniwered fhe, 
 if I had been entirely averfe to the propofals of 
 Mr. Munden, therefore both you and he are too 
 
 hafty in judging. -You know, brother, that

 ' poffible, in a tiling of fo mach confequence to 
 ' my future peace.' 
 
 Mr. Thoughtlefs was now fonnewhat better la- 
 tisfied than he had been, and after recommending 
 to her a conftancy of mind and refolt^tion, took his 
 leave of her. 
 
 This converfation having a little diffipated thofe 
 !gsy imaginations (he was before pofTefled of, /he 
 began to confider feiioufiy, what flie meant by 
 all this, and what it availed her ro give both her 
 lover and brothers fo much mafter of complaint

 fo far with that gentleman, that neither honour 
 towards him, nor regard to her own reputation, 
 
 would well fufter her to go back 5 ' Since it is 
 
 fo then,' faid fhe to herlelf, 'to what end do I 
 ' take all this trouble to invent excuies for delaying 
 what mud one day neceflarily be ? ' 
 i * Yet, wherefore mull it be,' continued Ihe ? 
 ' I have made no promile, and if a better offer 
 • fliould happen, I fee no reafon that obliges me 
 to reject it:—- for example,— ■ if Mr. True- 
 worth, or (uch a one as Mr. Trueworth, if his 
 ' equal is to be found in nature, neither my bro-

 me for quitting Mr, Munden.'

 had very much increafed 5 — but this her pride

 THE reader will «afily fuppofe, that in the 
 prefent dilpofirion of Mils Betly's heart, 
 Mr. Munilen met with but an indifferent reception 
 from her j— fhe avoided his company as much 
 as pt ffible, and when obliged to receive a vifit 
 from him, could not bring herlelf to treat him 
 with any thing more than a cold civility.— He 
 complained of her cruelty, — told her he had 
 expefted better things from her, after her brothers 
 had approved his flame j^-;^ he prefled her, in 
 
 the

 ; the mod pathetic terms he was mafter of, to let 
 !him know when the happy day would arrive, 
 which Ihould put an end to the long ferics of his 
 hopes and fears. 
 
 It is certain, that if this gentleman had loved 
 with that warmth and finceriry wLich fome men 
 have done, he mud have been very unhappy 
 
 during his courtfliip to jMifs Berly j but he 
 
 was altogether infenlible of the delicacies of the 
 paflion he profefled, — he felt not the pi;ns he 
 afFefted to languiOi under, — he could lupport 
 the fro'.vns, or even the flights of his niiltrefs, 
 without any other anxiety than what his pride in- 
 filled. 
 
 It was, therefore, rather owing to this lad pro- 
 penfity in his nature, than any emotions of a real 
 tendernefs for Mils Betfy, which had made him 
 perfevere in his adcirefTes to her. — — • All his ac- 
 quaintance knew he had courted her a long time ; 
 •— fome of them had been witnefs of her treat- 
 ment of him, and he was unwilling it rtiould be 
 faid of him, that he had made an offer of his 
 heart in vain. 
 
 He had, at firft, indeed, a liking of herperfon ; 
 ' — he had confidered her beauty, wir, and the 
 many accomplifhments fhe was poflfefled of, were 
 fuch as would render his choice applauded by the 
 
 world. The hopes of gaining her in a fliort 
 
 time, by the encouragement fhe had given his 
 addrefles, had made him purilve her with vigour 5 
 but the delays, — the fcruplcs, xMt capricioufnels 
 of her humour, —the pretences (lie of late had 
 made to avoid giving him a definitive anfwer, 
 had, at lengrh, palled all the inclinafii)n he once 
 had for her, and even defire v,^as deadened in him, 
 on lb many difappointments.

 It is, therefore, a very ill-judged thing in the 
 ladies, to keep too long in play the man they ever 
 defign to marry J and with all due deference to 
 that great wit and poet, fir John Suckling, there 
 are very few examples, which verify his maxim, 
 that 
 
 ' 'Tis expe(5}ation makes the blefling dear.' 
 According to my opinion, which is founded on 
 obfervation, another author, who wrote much 
 about the lame time with fir John, has given us 
 a more true idea of what a tedious courtlliip may 
 produce, efpecially on the fide of the man : — — 
 in a matrimonial dialogue, he makes the husband 
 excufe the coldnefs complained of by his wife, in 
 thele terms :, 
 
 ' Unequal lengths, aks ! our paffions run, 
 
 ' iMy love was quite worn out, e'er your's be- 
 
 This being the cafe with Mr. Munden, it ren- 
 dered Mifs Betly little lefs indifferent to him, in. 
 reality, than he had ever been to her : — to which 
 another motive, perhaps, mi^ht aifo be added, 
 viz. that of his indulging himfelf with amule- 
 ments with other fair ones, of a more kind com- 
 plexion y for continency, as will hereafter appear, 
 was not among the number of that gentleman's 
 virtues. 
 
 But enough of Mr, Munden for the prefent. — 
 It is now highly proper to give the reader fome 
 account what Mr. Trueworth was doing, while 
 Mil's Betfy v/as entertaining fentiments for him, 
 which he had Jong fince ceafed the ambition of 
 infpiring her with.

 moments, in which he had indulged a tender in- 
 tercourle with a woman of her abandoned prin- 
 ciples, filled him with the moft bitter rcmorfe, 
 and rendered him almoft hateful to himlelf. 
 To recolledt, that he had been the inltrument 
 I'ofherbafe defigns on Mils Betfy, and how cru- 
 'leliy he had wronged that lady, by a too rifli be- 
 lief, was, of itfelf, fufficient to inflime his rage 5 
 but when he reflected on this laft ad: of b.?fenei3, 
 which, if not providentially difcovereJ, might 
 have made his dear Harriot entertain fufpicions 
 of him, fatal to her peace, if not totally deilruc- 
 tive of their mutual happinels, the /liock of fuch 
 a misfortune, though happily fruilrated, was 
 more than he could bear with any tolerable de- 
 gree of patience. 
 
 Rage, difdain, and revenge, for the vile con- 
 triver of fo black an attempt, were the fii ft emo- 
 tions that took pofleffion of his mind 3 but the 
 violence of thofe paffions evaporating by degrees, 
 he began to think more coolly, and to reafon

 He was in the midfl of thefe contemplations, 
 when a letter from Mifs Flora was brought to 
 himj— n\e ftill flattered herfelf with being 
 able to work on his good- nature by fubtiiiflions, 
 and a feeming contrition for what Ihe had done, 
 and had accordingly wrote in the moft moving

 This ferved as a cover to the letter, which he 
 fent back dire<Sly by the meflenger that brought

 If the mind of Mr. True worth had been left 
 taken up than it was at prefent, this ugly accident 
 would, doubtlefs, have dwelt much longer upon 
 it J — but affairs of a more important, and 
 more pleafing nature, demanded his whole at- 
 tention. 
 
 The day prefixed for the celebration of his 
 marriage with Mifs Harriot, and alfo of that of 
 fir Baiiil and Mifs Mabel, had been delayed on 
 account of Mrs. Blanchfield's death. — • None 
 of thefe generous perfons could think ofindulge-

 Nor was this all : ■ — • Mr. Trueworth, to teftify 
 his gratitude and refpedl, ordered a very curior.s 
 monument of white marble to be ere(^i:ed over 
 her remains, the model of which he drew hini- 
 fclf, after one he had feen in Italy, and was 
 much admired by all judges of architeilure and

 That generous young lady would fain have 
 prolonged their mourning for a whole month,

 been prevailed upon to have fubmitted to, fir

 They were arguing on this topick one evening : 
 — Mr. Trueworth oppofed Mifs Harriot, as 
 much as he dur'i do without danger of offending 
 her 5 but fir Bazil plainly told her, that if fl:e 
 continued obfliiiate, Mifs Mabel and he would 
 finilli their affair without her. ^ Mrs. Wellair 
 urged the neceffr.y there was for her reii-rn, and

 npHOUGH it is not to be imagined, that the 
 •■• preparations ftjr marriages, fuch as thofe of 
 fir Bazil Loveit, and Mr, Trueworth, could be an 
 entire lecret to the town, efpecialiy as neither of 
 the parries had any motive to induce them to de- 
 fire it fhould be fo ; yet Mifs Betfy never heard 
 the leall fyllable of any fuch thing being in agita- 
 tion. Thofe of her acquaintance, whom ihe at 
 
 prefenr chieflv converfed with, were either igno- 
 rant of it themlelves, or had never happened to 
 mention it in her prefence 5 fo that knowing no- 
 thing of Mr. Trueworth's affairs of late^ more 
 than what the lawyer had cafualiy related at heic 
 brother's, it is not to be wondered at, that flie 
 imagined him wholly disengaged, fince the death 
 of that lady, who had fo kindly remembered him 
 in her will. 
 
 Neither ought it (her vanity confidered) to 
 appear flrange, that fhe was apt to flatter herfelf 
 with a belief of the return of his affe£lion to her- 
 felf, when the memory of the late object of it 
 fliould be utterly erafed. 
 
 When there is the leafir probability, that what 
 we ardently wifh may come to pals, the minut- 
 ell circumftance, in favour of our hopes, lerves 
 to aiTure us, that it certainly will do fo. 
 
 Mifs Betfy was going to make a vifit at White- 
 hall 5 but in croffing the park happened to meet 
 the two Mifs Airifhes, who afl^ed her to rake a 
 turn with them : -^- to which (he replied, rhat 
 Ihe would gladly accompany them, but had fent 
 word to a kdy that Ihe was coming to pais the

 whole evening with her. — — ' Nay,' faid the el- 
 der Mifs Airifli, ' we have an engagement too at 
 
 * our own apartment, and can Hay only to waiJc 
 
 * once up the Mai], and down again.'—- Mifs 
 Betfy replied, that would be no great lofsof time, 
 and fo went with them. — — They had not pro- 
 ceeded many yards in their promenade, before- 
 JVliis Betly faw Mr. Trueworth, with fir Bazij, 
 coming dirc61:ly towards them.— The gentle- 
 men bowed to her as they approached more near. 
 •— A I'udden thought that moment Itarting into 
 Mifs Betly's head, /he dropped her fan, as if by 
 acciilent^ as they were paffing each other, juft at 
 Mr. l\ue worth's feet j— he Hooped haitily to t.ike 
 it up, and prelented it to her; — ' I am forry, 
 
 * fir,' laid (he, 'to give yon this trouble,'-* 
 
 * VShatever ierviccs, madam, are in my power to 
 
 * render you,' replied he, ' will be alwa)sa plea- 
 
 * fure to m)lelf.' No more was faid}— — the- 
 
 gentlemen and the ladies purlued their different 
 routs.— —This little adventure, howevCi-, had a. 
 prodigious eflfeft on Mifs Betfy ^-— » fhe thought 
 jlie law fomething fo gay and fp.ukling in the 
 eyes of Mr. Trueworth, as denoted his mournipg 
 habit belied his heart, and that he was not much 
 affefled with the death of her, for whom decency 
 and gratitude had obliged him to put ir on. 
 
 Af er the genrlemen were out or hearing, the 
 two Mils Airifl;es began fo give their judgfments 
 upon thern : ■— the one cried, they were both. 
 very pretiy fellows 5 but the other accjled them 
 of want of polueneis, — * A& they law we had na

 repeated internally r'le woids of Mr. Truewortb, 
 and as llie was perluaded he wis now at liberty 
 to offer her all manner of Icrvices, flie i\iter- 
 pretec^, that -by ' v;hatever lervices were in his 
 
 * power,' he meant to renew his fer vices to her 
 
 as a lover. This imagination elated her to a 
 
 very hi«h degree, but hindered her from holding 
 anv converfjtion with the two ladies fhe was 
 with, as it was imprr-per for her to lay any thing 
 on the labj?^, which fo much engrofied her 
 thoughts. They all walked togerher up to Buck- 
 ingham-lioule, thert turned back, and the two 
 Mils Airifbes took leave of her at St. James's ; 
 -— they went into the palace, and /he was pro- 
 ceeding towards Spring-garden, when Hie at a 
 diftance perceived fir fiazil Loveit, Mr. True- 
 worth, Mil's Mabel, and two ladies, whofe faces 
 £i:ie was entirely unacquainted with. 
 
 The reader will not be at a lofs to guefs, that 
 t4iefe two were no other than Mrs. Weilair and 
 
 Mifs Harriot: they had been that afternoon to 
 
 take leave of lome friends, on their going out of 
 town, and had appointed to meet the gentlemen 
 in the Mall j — in their way thither, rhey had 
 called upon Mifs Mabel, and brought her with 
 them." ' '- This little troop being all in the fame 
 fable iivery, feemed fo much of a fimily, as 
 threw Mils Betfy into (ome fort of furprize ; — 
 fhe knew not that Mil's Mabel had th^ iealt ac- 
 qiiajntsnce with fir Bazil, nor even any more 
 with Mr. Trueworfh, than having feen him a 
 few times in her companj. — - As they drew 
 nearer, Ihe made a motion to Mils Mabel, as if 
 /he was defirous of fpeaking to her, — upon 
 which that lady advaticed towards her, with 
 thele words: ' I am forry, madam,' faid flie, 
 
 * as you are alone, that it is improper for me to 
 ' afk you to join us.' ' I am very glad, ma- 
 
 * dam,

i8o The HISTORY 5/ 
 
 * i'am, you do not,' replied Mifs Betfy, very 
 much picqued, ' becaufe I Ihould be obliged to 
 
 * retule you.'— —She no fooner uttered thele 
 words than fhe paffed haflily on, and Mifs Mabel 
 returned to her company, who waited for her at 
 fome paces diltance. 
 
 It mud be acknowledged, that Mifs Betfy had 
 €aufe to be alarmed at a fpeech of this nature, from 
 a lidy of Mifs Mabel's puliienels and e^ood hu- 
 mour j-— /he though: there mull be Icime very 
 powerful reafbns, which had obliged her to 
 make it ; and what thofe reafons could be, fecm- 
 ed at prefent an impenetrable lecret.— She was 
 too meth dilconcerted to be able to pals the whole 
 evening, as ihe had promifed the lady {he 
 
 went to (he would do ; llie,^ therefore, 
 
 presended a luddcn indifpofition, rook her leave, 
 and went home, in order to be at full liberty to 
 ruminate on what had paffed in the park. 
 
 She had not been many minutes in her own a- 
 partment, before fhe was interrupted in her me- 
 ditations, by the coming of her two brothers.—— 
 Several bullos, pi<flures, pieces of old chiLa, and 
 other curiofities, belonging to a nobleman, lately 
 deceafed, being to be expoled to fale, the elder 
 Mr. Though; iels had a.n inclinati(>n to become a 
 purchaler ol luch of them as he fliould find agree- 
 able to his fancy, but was willing to have his 
 lifter's judgement in the matter 5 and it was to en- 
 gage her to go with him the next morning about 
 twelve o'clock, when the goods were ro be exhibi- 
 ted to public view, that had occafioned him andMr. 
 Francis to make her this vifit. — Itis not to be 
 doubted, but that flie was willing to oblige him 
 in this point ;— /he alTured hii ., (lie would be 
 ready againft he came to call on her. 
 
 When Ihe was alone, fhe began to run over in 
 her mind, all the particulars of what had paflfed 
 
 that

 that evening in the park, and found fomething 
 rery extraordinary on the whole.—— It had Teem- 
 ed extremely odd to her, that Mr. Trueworth 
 and fir Bazil did not join her, and the two Mifs. 
 Airifhes j but then Ihe thought flie could eafily 
 account for their not doing fo, and that Mr. 
 Trueworth did not chufe to enter into any con- 
 ■verfation with her, becaule fir Ba^il had happen- 
 ed to lee her at Mifs Forward's, and might poffi- 
 bly have entertained no favourable idea of her oa 
 that fcore :— Ihe, therefore, with a great deal 
 of readinefs excufed Mr. Trueworth for this o- 
 miffion, efpecially as ilae was poAeired of the fan- 
 cy, that the compliment with which he returned 
 her fin, and the look he afifumed during that ac- 
 tion, feemSd to tell her, he wiflied for an oppor- 
 tunity of adding fomerhing more tender. — But 
 when fhe came to confider on the fecond meeting, 
 file was indeed very miich at a lois to fathom the 
 meaning of what ihe had feen 3 — - llie knew a 
 thoufand accidents might have occafioned aa 
 acquanitance between Mifs Mabel and fir Ba- 
 zil, and alfo, that the little /he had with 
 Mr. Trueworth might have been cafiially i^n- 
 provedj but could find not the lead; fhadovv of 
 reafm, why that lady fliould tell her, it was 
 improper for to afk her to j:iin company with 
 then).-— Though ihe had pf late leen that lady 
 lefs frequently than ufual, yet whenever they did 
 meet, it was with the grcateft civility and appear- 
 ance of friendfhip :— ihe had, in realitv, a fin- 
 cere regard for h^r , and imagined the otiier looked 
 upon her with the lame, and therefore could not 
 bur.fec-'icve, the Ihynefs (lie put en in the park, 
 when ipeaking to iier, muft have fonie very p^w- 
 «rtu] motive to occduon it. — Suipence was, of

 on any other account.——' In fpite of the i]I-

 * will go once more to her, — fatisfy my curiofi- 
 
 * ty, as to the manner of her behaviour, and then 
 
 * never fee her more.' 
 
 To be more liite of finding her at home, /lie 
 thought it beft to make the vifit /he intended iri 
 the morning : — accordingly /he fent to her bro- 
 ther, that being obliged to go to a lady, who had 
 deflred to fee her, /lie could not wait for his 
 coming to call on her, but would not fail to meet 
 him at the place of /ale, about the hour h.e had 
 mentioned. — This promife /lie thought it would 
 be eafy for her to perform, as /he de/igned to ihy 
 no longer with Mi/s Mabel, than would be fuf- 
 ficient to get fome light into a thing, which at 
 prefent gave her lb much perplexity. 
 
 She went about eleven o'clock, but was ftrange- 
 ly lurpriied, on her coming to the hou/e, to find 
 all the windows fhut up, and after the chairmen 
 had knocked feveral times, the door opened by 
 Nanny, the little prating; wench, who had lived 
 at Mr, Goodman's. — — ' Nanny !' cried Mifs Bet- 
 fy, * blefs me, do you live here?'——' Yes,

 the girl, 'my lady! 'why, madam, don't

 Mils Betfy, in the greatelt confufion, ' I thought

 faid Nanny J — ' you mean Mrs. Blanchfield,— — 
 I know all that ftory, — I was told it by one that 
 comes often here : — Mr. Trueworth, I affure 
 you, never courted her 5 — fhe was only in love 
 with him, and on hearing his engagement with 
 Mifs Harriot, took it to heart, poor (1)111, and 
 died in a few d.ays, and has left him half her for- 
 tune, and a world of fine things to Mils Harriot/ 
 She was going on with this tittle-tattle, but Mifs 
 Betfy was fcarce in a condition to diftingui/h what 
 file laid j — fhe leaned her head back againft the 
 chair, and was almoll fainting away. — The maid 
 perceiving the change in her countenance, cried 
 out, ' Lord, Madam, you are nor weil,-— fhall I 
 ' get you any thing ?— but now I think on it there 
 * is a bottle of drops ray lady left behind her in

 was going to do as fhe laid, but Mil's Betfy reco- 
 vering of herfelf, called to her to flay, faying, fhe 
 had no occafion for any thing.—' I>ord, Madam,* 
 faid Ihe, ' I did not think the marriage of Mr. 
 Trueworth would have been fuch a trouble to 
 you, or I would not have told ynu anything of

 for you with Mr. Staple, and how he followed

 It leemed as if fate inrereiled itfelf in a peculiar 
 manner, for the mortiiication of this young lady;. 
 — every thing contributed to give her the moft 
 poignant /hock herfoul could poffibly fuftain: — 
 it was not enough that fhe had heard the cruel

 misfortunes, her eyes mufl alio be wimefs of the 
 ftabbing confirmation : —the place of fale was 
 within two houfes of fir Bazil's ; but as /he had 
 never heard where that gentleman lived, could

 be prefented with, < On her chair turning into

 coaches, horfes, and a great concourfe of people*,

 crowd was io thick about the d' or, that it was 
 with I'ome difficulty the chair pafTed on, and fhe 
 had an opportunity of feeing much mo:e than Ihe 
 defired.— - There were three coaches and fix : — 
 in the firft, went fir Bazil and the new made lady 
 Loveit, the father of Mils Mabel, and a young 
 lady whom Mifs Beify had fonietimes leen in her 
 company ;— in the lecond, were leated Mr. True- 
 worth, his bride, Mrs. Wellair, and a grave old 
 gentleman j — the third was filled by four maid 
 lervants, and the two valet de chanibres of the 
 two bridegrooms, with a great deal of luggage 
 before and behind, — — The ladies and gentlemen 
 were all in extreme rich riding habits, and the 
 footmen, eleven in number, being all in new li- 
 veries, and fpruce fellows, the whole cavalcade 
 altogether made a very genteel appearance. 
 
 Mifs Betly, in fpite of the commotions in her 
 breaft, could not forbear Handing a little in the 
 hall, after fhe had got out of her chair, till the 
 whole had pafled,— — ' Well,' faid flie, to herfelf, 
 with a deep figh, ' all is over, and I mull think 
 
 * no^more of Trueworth 3 — but wherefore am I 
 
 * thus alarmed ? — He has long fince been loft to 
 
 * me, nor did I love him.' 
 
 She afTumed all the courage her pride could 
 fupply her with, ami had tolerably compofed her- 
 ielf before llie went up into the lale room j — •• 
 yet not io much but a palenefs, mixed with a 
 certain confufion, appeared in her cQjuntenance. . 
 Mr. Munden, who happened to be there, as well 
 as her brothers, rook notice of it, and aflced, if 
 fli* was not well ? To which flie replied, with 
 an uncommon prefence of mind, thar ilie was in

 caa;e along, by a great black ox, who, by the 
 R 3.. carelefTnefs

i86 The HISTORY ©/ 
 
 careltflnefs of the drivers, had like to have run 
 his horns quite into the chair. — Mr. Munden, 
 who never wanted politeneTs, and knew how to 
 put on the moft tender air whenever he pleafed, 
 exprefled an infinity of concern for the accident 
 file mentioned 5 and this behaviour in him (lie 
 either reliPned very well, or Teemed to do fo. 
 
 What credit her brothers gave to the ftory of 
 the ox is uncertain : '— they, as well as all the 
 company in the room, had been drawn to the 
 windows, by the noil'e of the cavalcade, which 
 had fet out from fir Bazil's. — Every one was 
 talking of it when Mifs Betfy entered, and 'tis 
 very probable the two Mr. Thoughtleflfes might 
 imagine it had an effc6l upon her, in f'pite of the 
 indifference fhe had always pretended •— they 
 were, however, too prudent to take any notice, 
 efpecially as Mr. Munden was prelent. 
 
 Whatever were the troubles of this young lady, 
 her fpirit enabled her to conceal them, and fixe 
 gave her opinion of the goods to be difpofed on, 
 with as much exaftitude, as if her mind had been 
 taken up with no other thing. 
 
 Mr. Thoughtlefs made a purchafe of the twelve 
 Cjefars in bronze, and two fruit pieces of Varelfl's, ' 
 and Mr. Munden, on Mifs Betiy's exprefling her 
 liking of two very large curious jars, bought' 
 them, and prefented them to her. 
 
 Nothing material pafled here 5 but the fale be- 
 ing over for that day, every one returned to their 
 rejpe^live habitations, or wherever bufinefs, or 
 inclination called them.

 I'^T^HE conftraint Mifs Betfy had put on herfelf,

 her } but when /he got home Hie gave a loofe to

 for Mr. Trueworth, /he would not allow herl'elf 
 to imagine, that Ihe was poffijfled of any for him,

 fiom any other motive, than that 9^ finding a 
 heart, that had once been devoted to her, capable 
 of lubmitting to the charms of any other woman, 
 i All Ihe could bring herfelf to acknowledge 
 Iwas only, that fhe had been very much to blame, 
 in treating the propofals of Mr. Trueworth in the 
 light manner fhe had done ;— (he now wondered 
 at herlelf for having been fo blind to the merits 
 of Mr. Trueworth's family, eftate, perfbn, and 
 accomplifhments, and accuied herfelf with the ut- 
 imoft leverity, for having rejefted, what fhe could 
 inot but confefs, would have been highly for her 
 lintereft, honour, and happinefs to have accepted. 
 Thus deeply was fhe buried in a too late re-

 Utterly impoffible was it for this unhappy crea- 
 ture to have lent her petition at a more unlucky 
 time ; Mifs Betly, full of the idea of the mil- 
 
 fortune fhe had fuflained in the lols of Mr. True- 
 worth, could not be reminded of Mils Forward, 
 without being alfo reminded, that the firft occa- 
 lion of his dilguft was owing to her acquaintance 
 with that woman. 
 
 'Infamous creature!' cried Mifs Bet fy as foon 
 as llie had done reading j— ' flie delerves no 
 
 * compaffion from the world, much lefs from me.

 Thefe were the firft reflections of Mifs Betfy, 
 on receiving fo unexpefted a petition, but they if 
 loon fiibfided, and gave way to others of a more 
 gentle nature 5 'Yet,' faid fhe, 'if the poor 
 
 * wretch is fenfible of her faults, and truly refolved 
 
 * to do as ihe pretends, it would be the utmoil |e 
 
 * cruelty to deny her the means of fulfilling the' 
 
 * promife /he makes of amendment.' 
 
 * How unhappy is our lex,' continued fhe, ' ei- 
 
 * ther in a too much, or too little fenfibiliry of the 
 
 * tender paffion 5 — /he was, alas! too eafily in- 
 
 * fluenced by the flatteries of the bafe part of man- 
 
 * kind, and I too little grateful to the merits of the

 In fine, the natural goodnefs of her difpo/Ttion 
 got the afcendant over all confiderations that op- 
 pofed the grant of Mifs Forward's requelf. — — 
 ' My acquaintance with her has been fatal 10 me,' 
 faid /he 5 ' but that was lefs owing to her fault than 
 ' my own folly.' 
 
 Accordingly fhe fent by the woman, who came 
 next morning, as mentioned in the letter, four 
 guineas encloled in a piece of paper, and wrote 
 to her in thefe terms : 
 
 To Mil's Forward.

 Though no one could have more refined notions 
 li virtue, not' a greater abhorrence for vice, than 
 3iis young lady, yet did /he never hate the per- 
 lops of the guilty, nor would judge with that fe- 
 lerity of their faults, which Ibnie others, much 
 i;fs innocent, are apt to do. 
 
 ) It pieafed her to think that by this donation flie 
 iiould gladden the heart of an afflified perfon, 
 vho had been of her acquaintance, how unworthy 
 ::)ever of late ihe had rendered herlelfj and this 
 utle interruption of her meditations crntnbuted 
 good deal to compol'e her mind, after the fud- 
 ien fhock it had luil:ained on the fcore of Mr« 
 Trueworth's marrio.ge. 
 
 But /he bad very ihortly another, and more 
 greeable relief:— fir Ralph and ia^ly Trufty 
 ame to town 3 — U'hich /he no fooner was inform- 
 d of, and where a houfe had been taken for their 
 deception, than Jhe went early the next morning 
 o pay her relpefts, and teflify the real fatisfadiion 
 he conceived at their arrival. 
 
 Nothing of bufine/s would probably have been

 The good baronet replied, that there was no-

 uttered not a word, either to oppofe, or to agree 
 to what had been laid. 
 
 Lady Trufiy perceiving her in fome confufion, 
 led her into another room, in order to talk Tcri- 
 oufly to her, on many things (lie had in her head.

 nPHE two brothers of Mifs Betfy having fome 
 •*" realbn to apprehend, flie would ftill findibme 
 pretence, if pciflible, to evade fulfilling the pro- 
 mife /he had made them, in regard to Mr. Mun- 
 den, and alto, that he, finding himfelf trifled 
 with, might become weary of prolecuting fo un- 
 availing a fuir, and break ofF as Mr. Trueworth 
 had done, relolved to omit nothing in their power 
 for bringing to a conclufion an affair, which 
 leemed to them icy ablblutely neceffary for fecur- 
 ing the honour of their family, in that of their 
 filler. 
 
 They fufpei^led, that her putting off the mar- 
 riage till the arrival of fir Ralph and lady Trufty, 
 was only to gain time, and invent fume excufe to 
 get that lady on her fide : — they therefore ju«lged 
 it highly proper to acquaint h«r previoufly with the 
 niotiv-es, which made them fo impatient to lee their 
 fifter dilpofed of, and by that means prevent her 
 ladyfiiip from being prepof[effed by any ideas the 
 other might prepare for thatpurpole. 
 
 Accordingly, Mr. Francis Thoughtlefs having 
 been informed by letter, of the day in wliich they 
 inter.ded to be in town, he went on horfeback, 
 and met them at the inn where they dined, about 
 twenty miles from London.

 That good lady was (o much troubled at the re- 
 cital he made her of Mlfs Betfy's late adventures, 
 that {he could not forbear letting fall fome tear^ ; 
 and though fhe laid the blame of her iIl-condu<5t 
 chiefly on her having lived fo long under the tuiiion 
 and example of a woman, fuch as lady Mellafm ; 
 yet fhe could not but allow there was a certain vani- 
 ty in her compofition, as dangerous to virtue, as to 
 reputation, and that marriage was the only defence 
 for both. 
 
 Sir Ralph, who was an extreme facetious, good- 
 natured man, was a little pleafant on what his lady 
 had faid on this occafion. — ' You forget, my dear,' 
 cried he, * how many ladies of late have broke the 
 ' conjugal hoop, and think themfelves juftified in 
 
 * doing fo, by having been prevailed upon to enter 
 
 * into it without inclination. Remember the 
 
 * words of the humorous poet Hudibras : 
 *' Wedlock without love, fome fay, 
 ** Is but a lock without a key ; 
 
 •' And 'tis a kind of rape to marry 
 '* One, who negle<Sls, or cares not for ye; 
 *' For what does make it ravifhment, 
 *' But being againft the mind's confent.' 
 * Does Mifs Betfy,' continued he, to Mr. Fran- 
 cis, * love the gentleman you would have her mar- 
 
 * n^r"---To which the other replied, * That the 
 
 * temper of his filler was too capricious for any one 
 
 * to be able to judge of the real fituation of her heart, 
 
 * or e\»n for herfelf to be perfectly afTured of it.' 
 Ke then proceeded to inform him how long Mr* 
 
 Munden had courted her, and of the great encou-» 
 ragcment (he had always given to his addrefies :— -- 
 her fubmitting the decifion of the affair to the elder 
 Mr. Thoughtlefs's infpe<3ion into the circumftances 
 of his eflate, which being found agreeable to there- 
 port made of it, {he now only vraited, or pretended

 to wait, for tlie approbation of Sir Ralph, as be- 
 ing by her father's will conftituted her guardian. 
 
 * Well then,' faid Sir Ralph, ' fince it is {'o, and 
 * you are all deilrous it fliould be a match, I fhall 
 ' jiot fail to give my verdi6t accordingly.' 
 
 As impatient as the two brothers were to fee her 
 married, and out of the way of thofe temptations 
 fhe at prefent lay under, they could not be more fo 
 
 than lady Trtfiy now was ; {he doubted not, 
 
 that the virtue and good fenfe of that young lady, 
 would render her a verygood wife, when onceflic was 
 made one, and tlicrefore heartily Vv'ifned to fee her 
 fettled in the world, even though it were to Jefs ad- 
 vantage, than her beauty, and t!ie many good qua- 
 lities ihe was pofiefled of might entitle her to expetSt. 
 
 It was in order to do every thing in her power to 
 bring about what fhe thought fo good a work, that 
 llie had drawn Mifs Betfy from the company, and 
 retired with her into the clofet, in the iTianner alrea- 
 dy related. 
 
 Mifs Betfy, who knew nothing of all this, or 
 even that her brother had gone to meet them on 
 the road, was extremely furprizcd to find by the 
 difcourfe, with v/hich lady Trufty entertained her, 
 that no part of what happened to her, ever fmce the 
 death of Mr. Goodman, was a fecret to iier lady- 
 fliip. 
 
 She prefently faw, however, it mufl: be by her 
 brother PVank, that this intelligence had been given, 
 and was not at all at a lofs to guefs the motive of 
 his having do^e it. * I find, madam,' faid fhe, 
 
 * that all the errors and inadvertencies I have been 
 
 * guilty of are betrayed to you, and am far from 
 
 * being forry they are fo, fince the gentle reproois 
 
 * vou take tl^e trouble to give me, are fo many 
 
 * frefli marks of the friendfhip v^ith which you 
 ' vouclifafc to honour me, and which I fhall always

 * felf, however, continued file, that the remeni- 
 
 * brance of what has lately befallen me, and the 
 ' imminent dangers l have efcaped will enable mc 
 
 * to regulate my conou«3:, in fuch a manner, 2s 
 
 * to give your ladyfiiip no farther pain on my ac- 
 
 * count.' 
 
 Lady Trudy on this embraced htr with the ut- 
 moil tcndernefs, and told her, that there were few 
 things file either wiilied or hoped for with greater 
 ardency, than to f>.e her liappilv fcaled, and freed 
 from all temptations of what i<ind foever. 
 
 This worthy lady then fell on the lubjeil: of Mr. 
 Msinden, and recapitulated all th^e arguments which 
 had been already ur-ied, to pcrfvvade her to corns 
 
 to a determination :. in fine, fiie left nothir.g 
 
 unfaid, that was fuitable to theoccafion. 
 
 Mifs Betfy liftencd to her with the mofi fubmif- 
 five attention, and after a fliort paufe, replied in 
 thefe terms : ' Madanl/ faid flie, ' I am con- 
 
 * vinccd by my own reafon, as well as by what 
 
 * your ladyfiiip has been pleafcd to fay, that I have 
 
 * indeed gone too far with Mr. MunJcn to be able 
 
 * to go back with honour, and fince I find he has 
 
 * the approbation of all my friends, fiiali no longer 
 ' attempt to trifle with his pretenfions.' 
 
 ' You will marry him then,' cried lady Trufiy ? 
 — — * Yes, madam,' anfwe^'ed Mifs Betfy ; and 
 added, tliough not without fome hefitation, ' fince 
 ' my marriage is a thing fo much defued by thofe, 
 ' to v/hofe will I Ciall always be ready to fubniit, 
 
 * Mr. Munden has certainly aright to ex^edtl 
 , * fiiould decide in his favour.' 
 
 She faid no more, but hung down her head, amd 
 
 lady Trufly was going to make fome reply, • 
 
 perhaps to afk how far her heart acquiefced in the 
 
 confent her tongue had given, but was prevented by 
 
 . Sir Ralph, who puftied open the door of the room 
 
 . v.'here they were, told her, fiie engrofled his fair

ig6 7;5^ H I S T O^R Y of 
 
 charge too long ; that it was now time for hlm- 
 
 felf, and her brothers to have fome fhare in their 
 Gonverfation. 
 
 ' Some polite wives, Sir Ralph,' faid lauyTrufly, 
 laughing, * v.'ouid not have excufed i'o abrupt a 
 
 * breaking in on their privacy, and 1 a/Ilire yoa, 
 *'if you had interrupted us a moment fooner, you 
 
 * might have fpoiled all ; for Mifs Betfy has but 
 
 * juft given me her piomife to marry Mr. Mun- 
 
 * den.' 
 
 * I fliould have been heartily forry indeed/ faid 
 he, * if my over zeal had rendered me a Marplot 
 
 * on this occafion ; but come,' continued he, 
 
 * fince the young lady has at laft refolved, let us 
 
 * carry the joyful news to her brothers.' 
 
 Ifi fpeaking thefe words he gave one of his hands 
 to lady Trufty, and the other to Mifs Betfy, and 
 led them into the dining room, where the Mr. 
 
 Thoughtlefles were : ' Well, gentlemen,' 
 
 faid he, * your fifter has at laft confented to give 
 
 * you a brother, — pray thank her for the addition 
 
 * ihe is going to make to your family.' 
 
 ' I hope,' faid the elder Mr. Thoughtlefs, ' fhe 
 
 * will find her own happinefs in doing fo.--- The 
 younger added fomething to the fame purpofe. — 
 After this the converfati(;n turned chiefly on the 
 folid fatisfatSiion of a married life, in which Mrfs 
 Betfy took but little parr, only faying to her tv/a 
 
 brothers : •■ Well, fince both of you have 
 
 ' fo liigh an opinion of matrimony, and will needs 
 
 * liave me, who am by fome years younger than 
 
 * cither of you, lead the way, I hope I {liall fooi> 
 ' fee you follow the example.' 
 
 * Our elder brother,' faid Mr. Francis, ' may,

 ' angry with the world for cor.demnirg n-iyv.art 
 
 * of judgment.' 
 
 * No more of that,' cried Sir Ralph ; * ycu 
 
 * fee file hears reafon at laft.' — Lady I'rufty would 
 fain have perfwaded the gentlemen to flay dinner 
 there, but they excufed themfelves, as expefting 
 company at home, and faid, if poflible they would 
 return towards evening ; fhe would not how- 
 ever permit Mifs Eetfy to take leave, and her con- 
 tinuing there that whole day happened to bring 
 things fomevvhat fooner to a conclufion, than per- 
 
 -hap.s they otherwife v/ould have been. 
 
 Mr. Munden, as foft and complaifant as he car- 
 ried it to Mifs Betfy, was very much difgufted in 
 h.is mind at her late behaviour ; — he found ftie ■' 
 loved him not, and was far from having any violent 
 inclination for her himfelf ; but the motives, which 
 had made him perfevere in his courtdiip, after be- 
 ing convinced of the indifference file had for him, 
 mude him alfo impatient to bring the afFair to as 
 
 fpeedy a refult as poffible. Sir Ralph was the laft 
 
 perfon to whom fhe had referred the matter ;-- he 
 had heard by accident of that gentleman's arrival, 
 and went to her lodgings, in order to fee in what 
 manner fhe would now receive him ; but not find- 
 ing her at home, ca'ied at thehoufeof Mr.Thought- 
 .lefs, who had always been very propitious to his 
 fuit. 
 
 On the two brothers returning frcm Sir Ralph's, 
 they mtt him juft coming out of the houfe :— — 
 the elder defired him to walk in — told him with a 
 great deal of freedom, that Sir Ralph yi.i come to 
 town ; - that the bufinefs having been commu- 
 nicated to him, he approved cf the match, and 'his 
 
 filler had confented, "-Mr. Munden received this

 and they exprefeJ no kfs fathfu£^ion fri the accom:

 formed him, that Mifs Eetfy was to ftay the whole 
 day with Sir Riilph and lady Trufty ; — that hiorifelf 
 and brother had promifcd to return thither in the 
 evening, and that he {hould be glad if he would ac- 
 company tl>€:n, in order that when they were &11 
 together, every thing might be fettled for the com- 
 pletion of the nuptials. 
 
 If is not to be doubted bet that the lover readiiy 
 embraced this propofition, and an hour fcr his wait- 
 ing on them being prefixed, he took his leave, the 
 company that was to dine wkb Mr.Thoughtiefs thai

 CHAP. XXV. 
 Will not let the Reader fall ajlcep. 
 
 I Believe the reader will eafily perceive^ that it 
 ^^^^ was owing to the apprehenfions of Ivlifs Betfy's 
 fluctuating diipofition, that her brothers tcrtified fo 
 great an impa'-ienee for bringing the affair of her 
 marriage to a conclufion ; and alio, that it was to 
 confirm her in her refolution, and reconcile her to 
 the promife fhe had made, that lady Trufly had 
 kept her with her that whole day. 
 
 The argumf-nts urged by thi,'t worthy lady; 
 the obliging and chcarful manner in which they 
 were delivered, joined to the facetious and enter- 
 tidiiing remarks, which Sir Ralph had occafionally 
 made, had, indeed^ a great efFefl for the prefent, 
 on the too wavering and uncertain mind they wers 
 intended to fix. 
 
 '] hough (he was far from expelling Mr. Mun-- 
 den would come that evening with her brothers, or 
 even from imagining, he could as yet be informed

 ©f what had pafled in his favour ; yet {be was net 
 difpleafcd when' fhe faw him enter, and if (he look- 
 ed a little confounded, it was rather to be attributed 
 . to modefty than anger. 
 
 That gentleman having made his firft compli- 
 ments to Sir Ralph and lady Trufty, on hi5 being 
 . prefented to them, flew directly to Mifs Betfy, and 
 cxprefied his fenfe of the happinefs her brothers 
 had made him Iicpe, in terms, the moft paffionate 
 that words coukl form ; — fhe received what he faid 
 to her, on this occafion, with a fvvcetnefs which 
 niuft have infinitely charmed a heart truly fenfible of 
 the tender paffion : — that of Mr. Munden, though 
 lefs delicate tlian he pretended, could not but be 
 greatly affected with it. 
 
 In fine, the beha-viour of both towards each other, 
 gave great contentment to all the friends of Mifs 
 Betfy y and her eider brotlser, for form's fake, re- 
 capitulating the pj opofal of Adr. Munden, concern- 
 ing lier fettlement and jointure, Sir Ralph gave that 
 approbation in public, which he before had done in 
 private : — ^ — the intended bridegroom and Mr. 
 Thcughtlefs agreed to go together the next morn- 
 ing to Mr. Markland the lawyer, and give hirrj 
 the ncceflary inftru6tions for drawing up the marri- 
 age articles. 
 
 They broke not up company till the night was 
 pretty far advanced, and Mr. Thoughtlefs not hav- 
 ing his own coach there, a hackney fet them all 
 down at their refpe£live habitations. 
 
 Thus far all went extremely well : the par- 
 ties chiefly concerned feemed perfcdfly fatisfied with 
 each other, and with themfelvts, for the agreement 
 they had mutually entered into, and there appeared 
 not the leaft likelihood of any future difficulty that 
 would arifc to interrupt, or delay the confummaticn " 
 ©f the fo much dcfired nuptials.

 Mifj Betfy had not as yet had time to meditate 
 on what fhe had given her proniife to perform : — 
 the joy fhe found her compliance had given all her 
 friends, the endearing things they faid to h.er up- 
 on the occafion, and the tranfport Mr. IMunden 
 had exprefled, on feeing himfelf fo near the end of 
 all his wifl:!es, had kept up her fpirits, and (lie ima- 
 gined, while in their prefence, that her inclination 
 had didated the confent her lips had uttered. 
 
 Eut when (he was alone,-— fhut up in her own 
 appartment ; — when fhe no longer received the kind 
 carell'es of her fniiling friends, nor the flattering 
 raptures of her future hufband, all the lively ideas, 
 
 ' which their converfation and manner of behaviour 
 towards her had infpired, vanifhed at once, and gave 
 
 •place to fancies, which might juftly bear the name 
 of fplenetic. 
 
 * I muft now look upon myfelf,' fald flic, * as

 fome ruhied building, whofe tottering roof feera- 
 ed ready to fall upon her head, and cru(h her ia

 At la ft, remembring, that they were all to dirie 
 at her brother's that day, by appointment, fhe rou- 
 fed herfelf as well as (lie was able, and ftarted from

 Mr. Munden could not now contain his temper; 
 —-he told her, he could not have expected luch 
 treatment, after his long fervices, and her favoura- 
 ble acceptance of them :---that he thought he me- 
 rited, at leafl, a (hew of kindnefs from her j and 
 in fine, that (he did not a6l towards him as becama 
 a woman of honour. 
 
 This was a reproacli, which the fpirit of Mifs 
 Betfy was too high to bear \ — fhe blufhed with 
 indignation, and carting the moft difdainful look 
 upon him, was about to make fome anfwer, which, 
 perhaps, in the humour he then was, would have 
 occafioned him to retort in fuch a manner, as might 
 have broken off all the meafures which had been fo 
 long concerting, if a fudden interruption had not 
 prevented it. 
 
 Mr. Francis Thoughtlefs not knowing any thing 
 of Mr. Munden's being there, and happening to 
 pals tint way, called on his fifter to know if (he was 
 ready to gu his brother's, it being near dinner time j

 Betfy, though in his heart very much vexed with 
 her, affedled to treat what Mr. Munden had faid 
 as a bagatelle, and calling to his fifter's footman to 
 get a hackney coach to the door, made them both 
 go with him to his brother's, faying, They would

 THOUGH. Mr. Francis Thoughtlefs did rot 
 judge it convenient to reproach his fifltr in 
 the prefcnce of Mr. Munden, on the complaints of 
 that gentleman ; yet fhe had no fooner vented the 
 little fpleen i]:!e had been that inftant poffciTcd of, 
 than fhe began to accufe herfelf of havii.g been too 
 poignant to a perfon, v.hom (he had promia'd to 
 make her hufband. 
 
 To attone, therefore, for the feverity of her late 
 behaviour,---' Ihis is a good handfome clean hack,' 
 faid (lie, with a fmile ; --' one would think my 
 
 * fellov/ had pitched on fuch a one on purpofe, to

 ' I only with, madam,' replied Mr. Munden, 
 
 * that you might be reconciled to fuch things as are 
 
 * in my power to accommodate you with, 'till I am 
 ' fo happy to prefent you with every thing you carl 
 ' defire.'— ' Let us talk no more of that,' cried 
 fhe ;— * be afllired that whatever I may have faidi 
 
 * I am far from thinking the happinefs of life con- 
 
 * fifts in gvandeur.' 
 
 Mr. Munden, on thefe words, kifTed her hand, 
 and fne permitted him to hold it between his, till 
 they came out of the coach. 
 
 This, indeed, had been the very lafl efFort of all 
 the maiden pride and vanity of M.ifs Betfy, and Mr, 
 Munden henceforv\'ard had no reafun to complain of 
 her beliaviour towards him. 
 
 SirRalph Tru fly, in regard to his age and charadler, 
 had the honour of nominating the day for the ce- 
 lebration of their nuptials, and Mifs Bctfy made no

 The good lady Trufty, as well as the two Mr. 
 T'houghtlcflcs, however, being not yet able to af- 
 fure theinfclves, that nothing was to be feared from 
 the uncertainty of her temper, did every thing in 
 their power to keep her in good humour Vv'ith her 
 fate :— and to their endeavours it may, perhaps, be 
 afcribed, much more than to the force of her oun 
 refolution, that {he ceafcd to be guilty of any thing 
 that might give the leaft caufe of difcontent to Mr. 
 Munden, or t)etray that which, in fpite of all fhe 
 could do, preyed upon herfelf. 
 
 To thef^i afliduities of her friends, another motive 
 might alfo be added, for the ketping up her fpirits, 
 which was that of her mind being continually em- 
 ployed i—Mr. Munden had taken a very handfome 
 houfe j---the uphuiiterer received all the ordeis for 
 
 the furniriiiiig it from her. There v/ere befides 
 
 many other tilings nccefTary for the rendering it 
 compleat, thr.t were not in his province to fupply : 
 
 the going, therefore^ to fhopsand ware-houfes 
 
 for that purpofe, took a very great part of her time. 
 ■What could be fpared from thefe, and feme 
 ether preparations for her wedding, either lady 
 Trufty, or her brothers, had theaddrefs to engage : 
 ——one or other of them were always with her, 
 ■till the night was far advanced, and fleep became 
 more welcome than any meditations fl^.e could in- 
 dulge. 
 
 The appointed day at length arrived ; fhe 
 
 was eondudcd to the altar by Sir Ralph Trufty, 
 where being met by Mr. Munden, the, ceremony 
 
 cf marriage was performed, no!:e being prefent

 'I'he indiflbluble knot now tied, ihey proceeded 
 to Pontac's, where an elegant entertainment being 
 prepared for them, by Mr. Munden's orders, they 
 dined, and afterwards went aUogether, to a lodging 
 Mr. Munden had hired for a fmall time, in a little 
 village five or fix miles from London. 
 
 This he had done to oblige his biide who had

 It Wi;uld be ncedlcfs to tell tlie reader, that there

 Mr. MuivJen expreiTed, and indeed fcir, ?.n

 many difHculties, which had for a long time con- 
 tinually rifen to impede his w'ifnes. The two 
 
 Mr, ThoughtlefTes were extremely overjoyed, on 
 thinking a period was put to ail their cares in relati- 
 on their filler : — lady Trufly aifo, and Sir Ralph

 what might be attributed to the modeliy of a virgin

 To this end, {he drew her into anotlicr room, a-

 had ibmething of moment to Hiy to her, began to 
 entertain her in the following manner: 
 
 ' My dear child,' faid (lie, ' you are now, I fear, 
 more through your compliance with the defirescf 
 your friends, than through your own inclination, 
 entered into a ftate, the happinefs of whicii great- 
 ly depends on the part you act in the firft fcenes 
 of it : — there are fome Women, who think they 
 can never tcftify too much fondnefs for their hus- 
 bands, and that the name of wife is a fuiticicnt 
 fandiian for givir.g a loofe to the utmoll cxccfics of 
 an e^vtravagant and romantic paflion } — but this is 
 a weaknefs, which I am pretty certain you will 
 lland in no need of my advice to guard againft. — 
 I am rather apprehenfive of your running into a 
 contrary extreme, equally dangerous to your future 
 
 peace, as to that of your hufband. A conilant 
 
 and unmoved inrenHbility will in time chill the 
 moft warm affection, and, perlwps, raife rufp'ci-,' 
 ens in him of the caufe, which would be terrible 
 
 indeed ; beware, therefore, I conjure you, 
 
 how you iiffedl to defpife, or treat with any 
 marks of contempt, or even of too much coldnefs, 
 a tendenicfs which he has a right to e.xpeiSt you 
 fhould return in kind, as far at leaft as mcdefiy 
 and difcrttion will permit you to bcrtow. 
 * As to your condudt in Lmiiy afFairs,' continu- 
 ed this good lady, ' I would have you always con- 
 fine yourfelf to fuch things, as properly appertain 
 to your own province, never interfering with fuch 
 as belong to your husband : — be careful to give to 
 him all the rights of his place, and at the fame 
 time maintain your own, though without feeming 
 
 to be too tenacious of them. If any difpute

 rather recede a little from your due, than contend 
 tc'u far ; bat let him icf:. you yield- more to oblige 
 him, than becaufe you think yourfclf bound to do 
 To.' 
 
 ' Mr. Munden, I flatter myfelf, has every quali- 
 ficiuion tc niakc you happy, anJ to fnew that your 
 fiiends, in advifing you to marry him, have not 
 mifled your choice ; but as perfcJ.ion is not to be 
 found on this fide the grave, and the very belt of 
 us are not exempt from the frailties of human na- 
 ture, whatever errors he may happen to fall into, 
 as it does not become you to reprimand him, I wifn 
 you would never take notice you liave obferved

 ing. 
 
 To give the more weight to thefe refieflions, fiic 
 alfo called to her mind the long perfeverance of Mr.

 fenfc, much more than compenfated for the want 
 
 of IncHiiation ; and without any of thofe lan-

 more real and more valuable proofs of thatpaifion, 
 than are fometimcs to be found aniongll tliofe, who 
 profefs themfelves, and are looked upor. by the world 
 as the moft fond wives. 
 
 In fpite of her endeavours, the thoughts of Mr. 
 Truevvorth would, however, fometimes come into 
 her mind, but file repelled them with all her might j 
 and as th^ merits of that gentleman would, in rea- 
 lit}', admit of no comparifon with any thing that 
 Mr. MuivJen had to boaR of, foe laboured to over- 
 balance the perfedions of the one, by that tender and 
 paffionate afieition with which Ihe flatrered herfelf 
 ihe novv' was, and always would be regarded by 
 the other. 
 
 Thus happijy difpofed to make the bonds fhe had 
 entered into eafy to herfelf, and perfedtiy agreeable 
 to the peifon with whom foe was engaged, he had 
 indeed a treafure in her beyond what he could ever 
 have imagined, or her friends, from her former be- 
 haviour, liad any reafon to have expected ; and had 
 he been truly fenfible of the value of the jewel he 
 pofTefTed, he v/ould have certainly been compleatly

 every one to enjoy, tho' heaven and fortune denies 
 nothing to their wifoes ; but of this hereafter. 
 
 At preftnt, all was joy and tranfport on the fide 
 of tlie Bride-groom ; — all complaifance and fweet-

 They continued but a few da}s in the retirement, 
 which had been made choice of for theconfunmiati-

 }y gay, — loved company, and all the rnodim diver- 
 sions of the times : and his wife, who, as the 
 
 whole coufie of this hiflory has Ihewn, had been 
 always fond of them to an excefs, and whofe hu- 
 moijr, in this point, was very little altered by the 
 change of her conJition, readily embraced the firfl: 
 p-rop6fal he made of returning to tov-n, believing (lie 
 Ihould now have courage enough to appear in pub-

 account of her niarriage, wluch he knew would 
 f ibjcct iier to the ridicule of t.iofe of her acquain- 
 tance, who had a greater (liart; of afiur. nee. 
 
 For a time tliis new married pair iecmed to have 
 no other tljing in view than pleafure; — Mr. Mun- 
 den had a numt.ous acquaintance,— — '-is wife not 
 
 a few J giving and receiving entertainments, as 
 
 yet engruikd their whole atttnri'm ; — each fmiling 
 hour brought with it Tome fiefh matter for fatibfac-

 But this was a golden aieam, v/hich could not he 
 cxpecied to be of any long continuance:— — thg 
 gaudy fcene vaniihed at once, and foon a darkening 
 gioorn overfprcad the late enchanting profpect.-- 
 A-lr. Munden's fortune could ijct fupport thefecon-

 Nothing can be more gal'ing to a woman of any 
 fpirit, than to ^fee herftlf at the head of a family 
 without r./fficicnt means to fupport her charcficr, as 
 fuch, in a haadfome manner : —the fair fubjcdl of 
 this hiftory had too much ccnerofity, and indeed too 
 much pride, in her compofitian, to endure that 
 there riiv.,iild be any want in fo neccfTary an article 
 of life, and as often as flie found occafson, would 
 have recourfe for a fupply to her own little purfe. 
 
 But this was a way of going on, which could not 
 ^a^c long :— (he complained of it to Mr. Mundcn; 
 --but though the remonftranccs fl-:e made him were 
 couched in the mofi: geittle terms that couid be, he 
 could not forbear tedifying a good deal of difplea- 
 fure on hearing them ; --he told her, that be feared 
 file was a bad (sconocnifl, and that as fl-e was a wife, 
 fhc ought to underfiand, that it was one of tlie main 
 duties of her place to be frugal of her husband's 
 money ; and be content with fuch things as were 
 fuitabk to his circumffances. 
 
 Thefurly' look with which thefe words were ac- 
 companied, as wel! as the words thcmfelves, made 
 her eafily perceive, that all the mighty paflion he had 
 pretended to have had for her, while in his days of 
 courtfhip, was too wfeak to enable him to bear the leaft 
 contradiction from her, now he was become a huf- 
 band. 
 
 She reflrained, however, that refentmcnt, which 
 fo unexpecled a difcovery of his temper had infpired 
 her with, from breaking into any violert c;^prefiions, 
 and only mildly anfwered, that fhe fliould always 
 be far from defiring any thing, which would be of 
 real prejudice to his circumflances ; but added, that 
 fhe was too well acquainted with his fortune, not to 
 be well affured, it would admit of keeping a table 
 much more agreeable to the rank he held in life, and

 Here he gave over fpeaking, but the confternati- 
 on his wife was in preventing her from making any 
 immediate anfwer, he refumed his difcourfe : 
 
 * Since we are upon this topic, my dear,' faid he,

 * reafonable you fliould be at the charge of.' 
 
 The innate rage, which, during the whole time 
 he had been talking, fwell'd her bread to almoft 
 burfling, would now no longer be confined :— — 
 
 * Good heavens !' cried flie, * to what have I re-

 Overwhelmed with pafTion, fhe was capable of ut-

 the moft outrageous grief and anger : — he fate fi-

 In concluding thefe words, he rofe and took hold 
 of her liand, but approached her v/ith an air fo cold 
 and indifferent, as was far from attoning, with a 
 woman of her penetration, for the unkindnefs of 
 his late propofal.— -* No, Mv. Munden,' cried (lie,

 poet : 
 
 ' Secrets of marriage fhould be facred held, 
 
 * Their fweets and bitters by the wife con- 
 
 ceal'd,' 
 
 But finding herfelf preftty ftrongly prefTed by 
 a lady, to whom (he had the greatcfl and moft 
 juft reafon to believe fhe ought to have nothing in 
 referve, {he hefitated rot long to relate to her the 
 whole ftory of the brulee (he had had with her huf- 
 band. 
 
 Lady Trufty was extremely alarmed at the ac- 
 count given her, and becaufe fhe would be fure 
 rot to miftake any'pait of it, made Mrs. Munden 
 repeat feveral times over every particular of this un- 
 happy difpute; then, after a paufe of fome mi- 
 nutes, began to give her advice to her fair friend in 
 the follov/ing terms : 
 
 * It grieves me to the foul,' faid that excellent 
 Jady, * to find there is already -any matter ofcom- 
 
 * plaint between you ; — you have been two months 
 ' married, and it is mcthinks, by much too early 
 '* for him to throw cfF the lover, and exert the huf- 
 '* band ; — biit finceit is fo, I would not have you, 
 
 ' for your fake, too much exert the wife: — I fear 
 ' he is of a rugged nature, — it behoves you, there- 
 
 * fore, rather to endeavour to foften it, by all the 
 
 * means in your power, than to pretend to com- 
 
 * bat v/ith unequal force ; — you know the engage- 
 ' ments you arc under, and how little relief all 
 ' the refinance you can make will be able to afford 
 
 * y°^-' 
 
 * Blefs me, madam !' cried Mrs. Munden, fpi- 
 rituoufly, * would your ladyfhip have me give up, 
 ' to the expence of houfe-keeping, that {lender pit- 
 ' tance allowed for cloaths and pocket-money in 
 '*' mv marriage-articles?' 
 
 ' No,

 * No, my dear,' cried lady Trufly, * far be it 
 
 * from me to give you any fuch counfel ;---on the 
 
 * contrary, I am apprehenfive, that if you fhould/ 
 ' fufFer yourfelf to be either menaced, or cajoled, 
 
 * out of even the fmalleft part of your rights, 'tis 
 ' poflible that a man of Mr. Munden's dilporitiun, 
 
 * might hereafter be tempted to encroach upon the 
 ' whole, and leave you nothing you could cali your 
 
 * own.' 
 
 ' It is very difEcult, if not wholly impoffible,' 
 continued Tae, ' to judge, with any certainty, ho'«v 
 ' to proceed v/ith a perfon, whofe temper one does 
 
 * not know ;--- lam altogether a llrangcr to tlut 
 ' of Mr. Munden, nor can you as yet pretend t=j 
 
 * be perfedly acquainted v/ith it ;--aii I can f^iy, 
 ' therefore, is, that I would have you maintain 
 ' your ov.'n privileges, v»ithout appearing too tena-

 ' I have then no other part to take,' faiJ Mr?. 
 Munden, ' than juft to lay out in tlie befl manner 
 
 * I can what money he is pleafed to allow, without 
 ' making any addition, what accidents foever may 
 
 * happen to demand it.' 
 
 ' I mean fo,' replied lady Trufty, * and when- 
 
 * ever there is any deficiency, as fome there mull

 To this Mrs. Munden, with a deep figh, made 
 znfwcr, that though flie was an ill dificmbler, and 
 befides had little room, from her huftand's late 
 carriage towards her, to flutter hcrfelf with any 
 good effecl of her fubmiffion, yet fhe would endea- 
 vour to foUow her ladyfl:iip's count'cl, in making 
 the experiment, however irkfome it might be to her 
 to do fo. 
 
 -They had a very long convcrfation together on 
 this head, during the whole courfe of which lady 
 'I'rufty laboured all flie could toperfwade the other 
 to look on heriuuation in a much lefs difligreeable 
 Jight, than in reality it.defervcd. 
 
 But hjvv little is it '\n the power of argument to 
 rcafon away pain ! -- one is much niOiC dcepiv af- 
 iL-dtcd with what cne feels than what one hears :- — 
 the heart of Mrs. Munden was befct v/ith thorns, 
 which all the words in the world would have been 
 incfFeftual to remove ;---dirappointed in every thing, 
 t!iat could have rendered this marriage fupportabje 
 to her ;---her good nature abufed,— -htr ipirit hum- 
 bled and deprclled, — no confiderations were of force 
 to moderate her paffions, but that m.elancholy one 
 that as her misfortunes were without a remedy, the 
 beft, and indeed the only relief, that fate permitted 
 was, in patiently fubmitting. 
 
 She aded, neverthelefs, in every refpe£t for fe- 
 veral days, conformable to the method ladyTrufly 
 had prefcribed, and reftrained her temper fo, as nei- 
 ther by word or adtion to give Mr. Munden any 
 juft caufe of ofFence ; he alfo kepthimfelf with- 
 in bounds, though it was eafy, for her to perceive, 
 by his fullen deportment, every time he was at ta- 
 ble, how ill he was fatisfied with the provifions fet 
 before him. 
 
 A cold civility on the one fide, and an enforced 
 complaifance on the other, hindered the mutual 
 difcontent that reigned in both their hearts from be- 
 ing

 ing perceptible to any who came to vifit them, and 
 alfo from breaking into any indecencies between 
 themfelves, 'till one day, a gentleman of fome con- 
 llderation in the world happening, unexpedlcdly, to 
 come to dine with them, Mr. Munden was ex- 
 tremely Ihocked at being no better prepared for his 
 entertainment. 
 
 ' What ! my dear,' faid he to his wife, ' have 
 
 * you nothing elfe to give us ? ' • To which the 
 repliecf, with a great deal of prefence of mind,-^ 
 
 * I am quite afhamcd and forry for the accident,' 
 ' but you know, my dear, we both intended to 
 
 * dine abroad to day, fo I gave a bill of fare ac- 
 
 * cordingly, and this gentleman came too late to- 
 
 * make any addition to what I had ordered.* 
 
 It may be eafily fuppofed the guefl: afTured them, 
 
 that there needed no apologies, that every thing 
 
 was mighty well, and fuch like words of courfe ; io 
 no more was faid upon this fubje(5l. 
 
 But the pride of Mr. Munden filled him wFth fa 
 much inward rage and fpitc, that he was fcarce a- 
 ble to contain himfelf till his friend had taken 
 leave, and he no fooner was at liberty to fey what 
 he thought proper, without incurring the cenfure 
 oi being unmannerly or unkind, than he began to 
 reproach her in the moft unjuft and cruel terms, 
 for having, as he faid, expofed him to the contempt 
 and ridicule of a perfon, who had hitherto held him 
 in the higheft eflimation. 
 
 She made no other reply, than that flie wa? no 
 lefs confounded than himfelf, at what had happen- 
 ed, that it was not in her power to prevent it, 
 
 that fhe could vvifti to be aKvays prepared for 
 
 the reception of any friend, and that (he was certain, 
 when he refledled on the caufe, he would be fa^ 
 from laying any blame on her. 
 
 In rpeaking thefe words, fhe ran to her cabinet^.

 * cut of your own annual revenue of pin-money.' 
 What ufage was this for a young lady, fcarce yet 
 
 three months married, — endued with every qualifi- 
 cation to create love and efteem, — accuilomed to 
 receive nothing but leflimonies of admiration from as 
 many as beheld her, and addreiTed v;ith theextremeft 
 homage and tendernefs, by the very man who now 
 feemed to take pride in the pov.'cr he had obtained 
 of thwarting her h.umour, and dejecting tiiat fpiric 
 and vivacity he had lb lately pretended to adore. 
 
 How utterly impoliible was it for her now to ob- 
 fcrve the rules laid down to her by lady Trufly ! 
 ——Could (lie after this fubmit to put in practice 
 any foftning arts fhe had been advifed to win her 
 
 lordly tyrant into temper ? Could fhe, I fay, 
 
 have done this, without being guilty of a meanneis, 
 which all wives mult have condemned her for. 
 
 But though the anfwers {he gave to the propofal 
 made her by this ungenerous hufband were fuch as 
 convinced him, fhe would never be prevailed upon 
 to recede from any part of what was her due by 
 contract, and though fhe teflified her refentment, 
 on his attempting fuch a thing, in terms haughty 
 enough, yet did fhe confine hcrfelf within the limits 
 of decency, not uttering a fingle word unbecoming 
 of her character, either as the woman of good un- 
 derhand ing, or the wife. 
 
 Mr. iMunden's notions of marriage had alwavs 
 been extremely unfavourable to the ladies ; — — he 
 confidered a wife no more than an upper fervant, 
 bound to fludy and obcv, in all things, the will of 
 him to whom flie had given her hand ; — and how 
 obfequiouo and fubmilTivc foever he appeared when 
 
 a lover, 
 

<#PG# 232>
224 The FI I S T O R Y of 
 
 a lover, had fixed his refolutlon, to render himfelf 
 abfolute mafter when he became a hufband. 
 
 On findlpw himfelf thus difappointed in his aim, 
 he was almoft ready to burft with an inward malice, 
 which not daring to wreak, as perhaps at that time 
 he could have wiflied, he vented in an aftion mean 
 and pttiful indeed, but not be wondered at in a man 
 pofTefled of fo fmall a fhare of afFedion, juftice, or 
 good-nature. 
 
 -The reader may remember, that Mr. Trueworth, 
 in the beginning of his courtfhip toMifs Betfy, had 
 
 made her a prcfcnt of a fquirrel ; < flie had f^ill 
 
 retained this firfl token of love, and always che- 
 
 ri(hed it with an uncommon care ; the little 
 
 creature was fitting on the ridge of its cell cracking 
 nuts, which his indulgent miftrefs had beftowed 
 
 upon him ; the fondnefs fhe had always (hewn 
 
 of him put a fudden thought into Mr. Munden'* 
 head, he flarted from his ehair, faying to his wife, 
 with a revengeful fneer, ' Here is one dcme- 
 
 * ftic, at leaft, that may be fpared.' — With thefe 
 words he flew to the poor harmlefs animal, feized it 
 by the neck, and throvving it with his whole force 
 againft the carved work of the marble chimney, its 
 tender frame was dafhed to pieces. 
 
 All this was done in fuch an inftant, that Mrs, 
 Munden had not time to make any attempt for pre- 
 venting it, but on the fight of fo difaflerous a fate 
 befalling her little favourite, and the brutality of 
 him who infli£tcd it, raifed emotions in her, which 
 file neither endeavoured, nor at that inftant could 
 have power to quell. 
 
 * Monfter .''——cried fhe;——* unworthy the 
 
 * name of man; you needed not have been

 f thefe,' replied he, fcornfully, ' to make me 
 * know that I was married to a termagant.' 
 
 Many altercations of the like nature pafTed be- 
 tween them, to which Mrs. Mundcn was the firft 
 
 that put a period : finding herfelf unable to re- 
 
 ftrain her tears, and unwilling he fnould be witnefs 
 of that weaknefs in her, (he flew out of the room, 
 faying at the fame time, that flie would never eat, 
 or fleep with him again.

 cant, yet very twce^ary te be tsld. 
 
 IF Mr. Munden had fet his whole invention to 
 work, in order to find the means oi^ rendering 
 himfelf hateful in the eyes of his wife, he could not 
 have done it more eftedually, than by his favage 
 treatment of her beloved fquirrel ;— — many cir- 
 cumftances indeed, concurred to fet this a<5tion of 
 his in the moft odious light that could pofTibly be 
 given it. 
 
 In the firfl place, the maflacre of io unhurtful a 
 little creature, who never did any thing to provoke 
 its fate, had fomething in it flrangely fpleenatic and 
 barbarous. 
 
 In the next, the bloody and inhuman deed being, 
 perpetrated by this injurious hufband, merely in 
 oppofition to his wife, and becaufe he knew it would 
 give her fome fort of affli£tion, was fufRcient to 
 convince her, that he took pleafure in giving pain 
 to her, and alfo made her not doubt, but he would 
 flop at nothing for that purpofe, provided it were 
 iafe, and came within the letter of the law.

 It grieved her to be deprived of a little animal flis 
 
 fo long had kept, with whofe pretty tricks {at 
 
 had fo often been diverted ; and it muft be confefled, 
 that to be deprived of fo innocent a fatisfadion, by 
 the s^xy man (lie had looked upon as bound by all 
 manner of ties to do every thing to pleafe her, Vi'as 
 enough to give the moil galling reflections to a wo- 
 man of her delicacy and fpirit. 
 
 But there was ftili another, and by many degrees 
 a more aggravating motive for her indignation ; — 
 if fhe had purchafed this fquirrel with her own mo- 
 ney, or if it had been prefentcd to her by any other 
 hands than thofe of Mr. IVuev/orth, not only the 
 lofs would have been lefs (hocking to her, but alfo 
 the perfon, by whom flie fuflaincd that lofs, woiild, 
 perhaps, have found lefs difficulty in obtain ii5g her 
 forgivenefs. 
 
 <:>\-\Q kept her promife, however, and ordered a 
 bed to be made ready for her in another room :■-- 
 Mr Munden came not home that night, 'till 
 very late j and being told what his wife had done 
 took not tlie leaft notice of it, buc happening to 
 meet her the next morning, as (he was coming 
 down flairs, * So, madam,' faid he, * I fuppofe 
 ' you fancy this cbitinate difobedience to your huf-

 ' When a hufoand,' anfwered (he, * is ignorant

 ' forgets to put it in practice, he can expedl neither

 They palled each other with thefe words, and 
 (he went direftly to lady Trufty, being impatient 
 to acquaint her with the behaviour of her hufband 
 towards her fmce fhe laft had feen her. 
 
 This worthy lady was ai1;onifhed beyond meafure 
 at the recital ; — —it feemed fo (trange to her, that

 of obliging his wife, to convert to the family ufes, 
 what had been fettled on her for her own private 
 txpences, that fhe could not have given credit to it 
 from any other mouth than that of the weeping 
 
 fufFerer : his killing of the fquirrel alfo, though 
 
 a trifle in itfelf, flie could not help thinking deno- 
 ted a mofl cruel, revengeful, and mean mind. 
 
 But how much foever fhe condemned him in her 
 heart, (he forbore expreffing the whole of her fen- 
 timents on this occafion to his wife, being willing, 
 as they were joined to each other, by the moft fa- 
 cred and indiflbluble bonds, rather to heal, if pof- 
 fible, the breach between them, than to add any 
 thing which might ferve to W'iden it. 
 
 She told her, that though ihe could not but con- 
 fefs, that Mr. Munden had behaved tov/ards her,

 rent from what he ought to have done, or Vv'hat 
 might have been expeifted from him, yet flie was 
 forry to find, that (he bad carried things to that ex-

 Mrs. Munden making no anfwer to this, and 
 
 looking a little perplexed, ' I do not mean, by

 ' perfwade you to make any mean fleps towards a

 Trufty made ufc of, that either her duty, her in-

 by them : this point being gained, the manner 
 
 in which the matter fhould be conducted, was the 
 next thing that employed her thoughts. 
 
 It feemed bcft to her, that the two Mr. Thcught- 
 lefles fhould not be made acquainted with any part 
 of what had pafied, if the bufinefs Ihe fo m.uch wifh- 
 ed to fee accomplifhed could be efFedled without 
 
 their knowledge ; her reafcn for it was this :— 
 
 they were both men of pretty warm difpofitions, 
 efpecially the younger, and as they had been fo af- 
 fiduous in promoting this match, fo early a breach, 
 and the provocations given for it by Mr. Munden, 
 might occafion them to fliew their refentment for 
 his behaviour in a fafhion, which would make what 
 was already very bad, much woife. 
 
 * * Sir Ralph is a man in years,' faid fhe, — ' has 
 
 * been your guardian, and I am apt to believe, that 
 
 * on both thefe accounts his words will have feme 
 
 * weight with Mr. Munden :— the friendfhip which

 ' privilege of adding fomething in my turn ; and I 
 
 * hope by our joint mediation this quarrel may be 
 
 * made up, fo far at leaft as that you may live ci- 
 
 * villy together.' 
 
 Mrs. Munden made no other reply to^what her 
 ladyfhip had faid, than to thank her for the intercfl: 
 file took in her afFairs, and the trouble (he was 
 aboujt to give Sir Ralph on her account. 
 
 T)ie truth is, this young lady would in her heart 
 have been much beiter fatisfied, that there had been 
 a poflibility of being feparated for ever, from a. 
 perfon, v/ho, (he was now convinced, had neither 
 love nor efteem for her, rather than to have con- 
 fented to cohabit with him as a wife, even though 
 he fhould be prevailed upon to rcquefl it, in the 
 moft feemingly fubmiffive terms.

 TH E fpirlts of lady Mellafin had for feveral 
 months been kept up by the wicked agents 
 fhe had employed in the management of the worft 
 caufe, that ever v/as taken in hand : — thofe fubtle 
 and mod infamous wretches, in order to draw frefh 
 fupplies of money from that unhappy woman, had 
 ftill found means to elude and baffle all the endea- 
 vours of Mr. Goodman's honeft lawyer, to bring 
 the matter to a fair trial. 
 
 But at lift all their diabolical inventions, — their 
 evarions,~theIr fubterfuges failing, and the day ap- 
 pointed, which they knew muft infalJibly bring the 
 whole dark myilery of iniquity to light, when all

 Yet fo cruel were they, even to the very wo-

 thing in her favour, did {he know (he was undone, 
 deferted, and left alone to bear the brunt of all the 
 offended laws inflid on forgery. 
 
 What words can reprefent the horror, the 
 
 Confufion of her guilty mind, when neither the per- 
 fon who drew up the pretended will, nor either of 
 thofe two who had fet their names as witneffes ap- 
 pearing, (he fent in fearch of them, and found they 
 were all removed from their habitations, and Eed, 
 no one could inform her where. 
 
 Scarce had fhc time to make her efcape out of the 
 court, before word was given to an officer to take 
 
 her into cuftody ; not daring to go home, nor 
 
 knowing to whom flie could have reccurfe for (helter 
 in tills exigence, (he ran like one diftracted through 
 the ftreets, 'till fhe came to one of the gates of St. 
 James's park, where meeting with a porter, flie 
 fent him to her lodgings, to order her daughter Flo- 
 jaj and Mrs. Prinks, to come that inflant to her. 
 
 Mrs. Prinks immediately obeyed the fummuf.s, 
 but Mifs Flora had the audacity to dcfiie to he ex- 
 cu fed, being then drcfTmg to go on a bufincfs, which 
 indeed fhe then imagined was of much more corifL:;- 
 quence to herfelfthan any thing relating to her m^ 
 ther could poiiibly be. 
 
 After this diilulute and unfortunate creature was 
 left by Mr. Trueworth, in the manner defcribed in 
 the third volume of this hiRory, (he gave a loofe to 
 agonies, which only thofe who have felt the fame 
 can be capable of conceiving. 
 
 Her (lirieks, and the rcqueft Mr. Truewcrtli had 
 made on his going out, brought up tiie woman of* 
 the houfe herfelf, to adminifter what relief was in 
 her povver, to a la^y who feemed to fland in fo much 
 need of it. T** 
 
 Having prevailed on her to come down flairs, His 
 
 feated her in a little room behind the bar, and as file 
 
 favv the violence of her paffions threw her into fre-

<#PG# 240>
23 2 r^^ H I S T O R Y of 
 
 quent faintings, negleded nothing which (he thought 
 might be of fervice to recover her fpirits, and com- 
 pofe her mind. 
 
 As file v/as thus charitably employed, a young 
 gentiemaji, who ufed the houfe, and was very free 
 with all belonging to it, happened to come in : 
 Miis Flora, befides being handfome, had fomething 
 extremely agreeable and engaging in her air, and bad 
 her heart been poiTefTed of half that innocence her 
 countenance gave the promife of, her charader 
 would have been as amiable as it was now the con- 
 trary. 
 
 There are fomc eyes which fliine thro' their tears, 
 
 • and are lovely in the midll of anguifh : thofe of 
 
 Mifs Flora had this advantage, and fhe appeared, in 
 fpite of her diforder, {o perfectly charming to the 
 {tranger, that lie could not quit the place without 
 joinir.g his endeavours to thole of the good nr^tur'd 
 hol^'efs for her confolation, and had the fatistaclion 
 to fuid them much more effectual fur that purpofe. 
 
 The afEi(51ed fair one finding herfelf fomevvhat 
 better, thanked the good woman in the politell terms 
 for the pains flie had been at ; but the gentleman 
 Miould not be denied feeing her fafe home in a coach, 
 faying, the air on a fuduen might have too violent an 
 eftect on her fo lately recovered fpirits, anH that it 
 was nut fit file Tnould be alone in cafe of accidents. 
 
 Mifs Flora was eafily prevailed upon to accept 
 this obliging ofter ; — -~he attended iier home, — 
 Jtayed about half an hour with her, and entreated, 
 file would give him permiflion to come the next 
 day, and enquire after her health. 
 
 She knew the world too well, and the difpofition 
 of n^ankind in general, not to fee that there was 
 fomething more than mere compafiion in the civili- 
 ties he had (hewn to her ; fhe examined his 
 
 perfon,— - his behaviour, and found nothing in either 
 that was not perfedly agreeable \ and though fhe 
 
 had 
 

<#PG# 241>

 had really loved Mr. Trueworth to the greatefl cx- 
 cefi that woman could do, yet, as (he knew he was 
 irrecoverably loft, fhe looked upon a new attach- 
 ment as the only fure means of putting the paft out 
 of her head. 
 
 A very few vifits ferved to make an eclaircifiment 
 of the thoughts they mutually had entertained of 
 each other, and as he had found by the woman of 
 the tavern, that the diftrefs of this young lady had 
 been occafioned by a love quarrel with a gentleman, 
 who had brought her into that houfe, he began with 
 expreffing the utmoft abhorrence of that injuflice 
 and ingratitude, which fome were capable of ; — 
 
 * but,' faid he, ' if Ibme of us have neither love 
 
 * nor honour for thofe that love us, we all certainly 
 
 * love our own happinefs, and he muft be ftupid 
 ' and infenfible, indeed,' added he, embracing her 
 with the warmeft tranfport, ' who could not find 
 ' it eternally within thefe arms.' 
 
 * You all talk fo,' anfwered flie, with the moll 
 engaging fmile fhe could put on ;-— ' but as my 
 
 * youth,— -innocence,-— and, perhaps, a little mix- 
 
 * ture of female vanity have once milled me, it 
 
 * behoves me to be extremely cautious how the 
 
 * tender impulfe gets a fecond time poffefiion of 
 ' my heart.* 
 
 In fine, fhe put him not to a too great expenc© 
 of vows and proteftations before fhe either v/as, or^ 
 pretended to be convinced of the fincerity of his paf- 
 fion, and alfo rewarded it in as ample a manner as 
 his foul could wiih. 
 
 It is certain, that for a time, this new gallant be- 
 haved U'ith the extremeH: fond nefs towards her,-— 
 did every thing that the mo(r ardent lover could do 
 to pleafe her,---he treated her,-- -carried her to all 
 public places of enteitainment, and what in her pre- 
 fent circumftances was moO: ncceflary to her, was 
 X 3 continually 
 

<#PG# 242>
234 r>^^ H I S T O R Y of 
 
 continually making her very rich and valuable prc- 
 fents. 
 
 But it could not be expedted, that an amour en- 
 tered into in this manner, and which had no folid 
 elteem on either fide for its foundation, would be of 
 any long continuance :— -the gentleman had a great 
 deal of good nature, but was gay and inconftant, as 
 the moft variable of his fex ;-— he found a new 
 charm in every new face that prefented itfelf to him, 
 ---and as he wanted no requifites to pleafe the fair, 
 he too feldom failed in his intents upon them. 
 
 Mifs Flora was not ignorant, that he had many 
 amufements of this kind, even while he kept up the 
 moft tender correfpondenj:e with her ; but perceiving 
 that both reproaches and complaints were equally in 
 vain with a man of his humour, fte had the cun- 
 ning to forbear periecuting him with either, and by 
 appearing always eafy, degagee, and unconcerned, 
 preferved her acquaintance with him, and received 
 proofs of his liberality long after Ihe had loft thofe of 
 his inclination. 
 
 On being told, that he was going on a party of 
 pleafure into the fouth of France, Ihe cxcrcifed all 
 her wi;: and artifice to engage him to permit her 
 to be one of the company ; but he treated this re- 
 queft: as a mere bagatelle,— -faid the thing was utter- 
 ly impradlicable,--- that none of the gentlemen took 
 any ladies with them,---fo he would not have her 
 think of it. 
 
 It was in order to take her leave of him, before 
 his departure, that flie was going to his lodgings 
 when lady Meilafin had fent for her into the park. 
 
 The cool reception he had given her fent her 
 home in a very ill humour, Vv'hich was greatly 
 heightened by a letter, which fhe found Mrs. Frinks 
 had left for her on tiie table. 
 
 That woman having joined her lady in the park, 
 and confuitcd together what was to be done, they 
 
 took

 took a hackney coach, and drove to an obfcure part 
 of the town, where they hired lodgings in a feigned 
 name, after which Mrs. Prinks hurried home,— - 
 packed up what cloaths, and other necelTaries fhe 
 thought would be immediately wanted, and after 
 having wrote a (hort account to Mifs Flora of the 
 misfortune that had happened, and given her direc- 
 tions where to come, returned with all hafte to her 
 difconfolate lady.

 The contents of her letter to that much injured 
 gentleman were as follow : 
 
 To Edward Goodman, Efq; 
 
 « Sir, 
 
 Appearances are fo much againft me, that I 
 fcarce dare fay I am innocent, though I 
 know myfelf fo, as to any intention of doing you 
 injuftice : — I cannot, however, forbear giving you 
 
 * a fliort fketch of the impofition which has been 
 
 * pradifed upon me, and in my name attempted to 
 
 * be put on you. 
 
 * The will, which has occafioned this long con- 
 
 * teft between us, was brought me by a perfon, 
 
 * who told me, be had drawn it up exadly accord - 
 
 * ing to my late husband's inftrudions, the very 
 
 * evening before he died ; the fubfcribing wit- 
 
 * nefTes gave me the fame afTurance, and alfo added, 
 
 * that Mr. Goodman was fo well convinced of my 
 
 * integrity, and the wrong he had done me by 
 ' fufpeiting it, that had he lived only to the next 
 ' morning, he had refolved to fend for me heme, 
 ' and be reconciled to me in the face of the world ; 
 
 * — — fo that if the thing was a piece of forgery, 
 
 * thefe men are only guilty, — — I am entirely free 
 « from any fliare in it. 
 
 ' But as thefe proceedings, which I have unhappi- 
 ' ly been prevailed upon to countenance, have gi- 
 ' ven you a great deal of trouble and expence, I fin- 
 ' cerely afk your pardon for it: — this is all the at- 
 ' tenement I can make to heaven for offences more 
 
 * immediately my own. 
 
 ' I am very fenfible, notwithftanding, thatby Vv'hat

 friendfhip and favour of the perfon he has mad^

 to you, or how^ great my faults in reality may havte 
 been, I cannot help being of opinion, that whep 
 you remember I was once the wife of an uncl^i^ 
 vvhofe memory you have fo much caufe to value, 
 you will think the name and character I have borne 
 ought to defend me from public infamy, parifli 
 alms, and beggary. 
 
 ' Reduced as 1 am, it would ill become me to 
 make any ftipulations, or lay a tax on the good- 
 nefs I am necelTitated to implore. — No, Sir ; as I 
 can now demand nothing, fo alfo I can hope for 
 nothing but from your compaffion and generofity, 
 and to thefe two amiable qualities alone fhall af- 
 cribe whatever provifion you fhall think fit to 
 make for me, out of that abundance I was once 
 in full poflefTion of.

 Lady Mellafm chofe to fend Mifs Flora with this 
 letter, as believing her agreeable perfon and man-

 the youthful heart of the perfon it was addrefTed to, 
 than could have been expefled from the formal and 
 affeded gravity of Mrs. Prinks.

 ^ It is not unlikely too, but that fhe might flatter 
 fierfelf with the hopes of greater advantages, by 
 ^cr daughter's going in perfon to Mr. Goodman's, 
 tlian thofe, which her letter had petitioned for :--- 
 me had often heard, and read, of men, whofe re- 
 iVntnient had been foftened and melted into 
 tendernefs, on the appearance of a lovely ob- 
 
 j*^ : —as the poet fomewhere or other expref- 
 
 fes it, 
 
 ' Beauty, like Ice, our footing does betray ; 
 
 * Who can tread fure on the fmooth flipp'ry 
 ' way r 
 
 Mifs Flora herfelf was alfo very far from being 
 difpleafed at going on this errand, and as it was not 
 proper for her to drefs in the manner (he would 
 have done,'on making a vifit to any other perfon, it 
 coft her fume time before her fetting out, to equip 
 herfelf in fuch a defhabillee, as fhe thought would 
 be mod genteel and become her beft. 
 
 She had the good fortune to find Mr. Goodman 
 
 at home, and was immediately introduced to him j 
 
 he was a little furprlfed at a vifit made him 
 
 by a young lady, whom he had never feen before, 
 
 but not enough to prevent him from receiving her 
 
 with the utmoft complaifance ; he faluted her, 
 
 ' ■ ■ feated her in a chair, and then afked, what 
 
 commands fhe had to- favour him with: on 
 
 which taking out a letter, and giving it to him ; 
 
 * This, Sir, faid fhe, with a deep figh, 
 
 ' will inform you of the requeft that brings me 
 * here.' 
 
 Mr. Goodman read it haftily over ; but while 
 he was doing fo, could not forbear fhaking his 
 head feveral times, but fpoke nothing, 'till atter jl 
 paufe of fome minutes, ' Madam,' faid he, * as 
 ' this is a bufmefs, which I could not expe£t to 
 ' have heard of, I muft confefs myfelf altogether 
 ' unprepared how to proceed in it. — If lady Mclla-

 * fin,' added he, ' will give herfelf the trouble to 
 
 * fend in three or four days, fhe may depend on an 
 
 * anfwer from me.' 
 
 The coldnefs of thefe words, and the diftant air 
 he afTumed while fpeaking them, fo widely differ- 
 ent from that with which he had accof^ed this lady 
 on her firft entrance, made her prefently fee, fhe 
 bad nothing to hope from thisembafi]', on her owri 
 account, and made her alfo tremble for that of her 
 mother. 
 
 As he urged her not to ftay, nor even gave the 
 leaft hint, that he was defirous of her doing fo, fhe 
 rofe, and with a mod dejedled air took her leave, 
 telling him, in going out, that fhe fhould not fail 
 of acquainting lady Mellafin with his commands, 
 who, fhe doubted not, would be punctual in obey- 
 ing them. 
 
 Mr. Goodman was, indeed, too well acquaint- 
 ed with the charadler of Mifs Flora to be capable 
 of receiving any impreflion from the charms nature 
 had beftowed upon her, even though they had been 
 a thoufand times more brilliant, than in efFedl they 
 were, and fhe had not been the daughter of a wo- 
 man, who had rendered herfelf fo juftly hateful to 
 him. 
 
 Lady Mellafin was fhocked to the very foul, at 
 being told the reception her daughter had met with, 
 and could not help looking upon it as a very bad 
 omen of her future fuccefs ; — flie doubted net but 
 by his faying, that he muft have time for delibera- 
 tion, he meant, that he would do noihing in this 
 point without having firft confulted his fiiends, 
 and ihe had no reafon to expedt, that any of th- fe 
 he converfed with would give council in her fa- 
 vour. 
 
 To be reduced from a ftate of opulence and re- 
 fpe(£l-, ro one of poverty, contempt, and wrctch- 
 ednefs, is terrible indeed i but much more fo, when

 accompanied with a confcioufnefs of having deferved 
 by our vices, and ill condudl, all the misfortunes 
 we complain of. 
 
 Lady Mellafin having no pleafing reflection of 
 having done her duty in any one point in life, it 
 would not have been ftrange, that thus deftitutc 
 of all comfort from within j all fuccour from 
 without, if (he had yielded herfelf to the iaft de- 
 fpair. 
 
 She, neverthelefs, amidft all the diftra£tion of 
 her thoughts, fiill continued to teftify a refolution, 
 feldom to be found among women of her aban- 
 doned principles, never departing from this maxim, 
 that in the worfl of events notbuig was to be nc- 
 
 gledled : on the third day Ihe fent Mrs. Prinks, 
 
 to wait on Mr. Goodman for his aniwer, having 
 experienced the little cfFeit her daughter's prefence 
 had produced. 
 
 It is a thing well worth the obfervation of all de- 
 grees of people, that tnc truly generous never keep 
 long in fufpence the perfons they think proper ob- 
 je£is of the.r bounty. — h favour that colis too 
 much pains in obtaining, lofes great part of its 
 value ; — it palls upon die minu of the receiver, 
 and looks more like being extorted than beftow-

 Mr. Cowley, though a man, whofe great merit 
 one would think (hould have fet him above the 
 neceffity of making any requeft of a pecuninary na- 
 ture, was certainly obliged fometimes to foilicitati- 
 ons that were very untafy to hmi, and drew from 
 him this emphatic exclamation, 
 
 * If there's a man, ye gods, I ought to hate, 
 ' Attendance and dependance be his fate.'

 both by the lawyer, and the two Mr. Thoughtlef- 
 fcs, that it W..S his late uncle's intention, that flie 
 fliould not be left without a decent provifion, and 
 being willing to conform, as much as p^jinble, to all 
 the defires of a perfon, whom he had alvvaj's e-

 fince his dea^h fhc had attempted to do to himfelf,

 rendered you fo obnoxious, the better.

 This he ordered to be delivered to any one, who 
 fiiould fay they came from bdy Mcllafin, and Airs. 
 Prinks accordingly received it. 
 
 Lady Meliafm, in the miferable circumffarces to 
 ivhich flie had reduced herfclf, was tranfported to 
 find ihs (hculd not be entirely left without f p- 
 
 port : as for her being obliged to quit London, 
 
 ilie was not in the ieaft fhocked at it, as there W2S 
 no pf.ffibiiity for her ever to appear publickly in ir, 
 and fhe was rather defirous than averfe to be out 
 of a place, v.hich could no longer afrord her 
 thofe pieafures and amufements, fhe lud once 
 io much indulged herfelf in the enjoyment of. 
 
 But when fne confidered on her Lanifliment, and 
 ran over in her mind, what part of England flie 
 fhould make choice of for her afylum, the whole 
 kingdom appeared a defert to her, wliCn driven 
 fiom the gaieties of the court and capital ; - ■ ■ - 
 fne, therefore, refolved to go farther, and enter 
 into a new fcene of life, uhieh might be more 
 likely to obliterate the memory of the former ; — 
 
 fce had heard much t^lk of Jamaica, that it 
 
 was a rich and opulent place, that the inhabi-

 tants thought of lutle elfe, but how to divert them- 
 fclvcs in the beft manner the country afforded j and 
 that they were not too ftridt in their notions, either 
 
 as to honour or religion ; that reputation was a 
 
 thing little regarded among them ; — fo that in cale 
 the occafion which had brought her thither ihould 
 happen to be difcovered, {he- would not find herfelf 
 in the lefs eftimation. 
 
 She therefore hefitated not to write a fecond 
 letter to Mr. Goodman, acquainting him with 
 her defirc of going to that plantation, and hinting 
 tQ him, that, as it would be giving him too great a 
 trouble to remit the quarterly payments he menti- 
 oned, file fhouid take it as a particular favour, if. 
 he v/ould be pleafed to beftow on her fuch a fum as 
 he fhould think proper, in lieu of the annuity he 
 had offered. 
 
 Mr. Goodman v/as extremely pleafed with this 
 propofal, and feveral letters having paffed between 
 them, concerning the conditions, he agreed to give 
 her two hundred pounds in fpecie, to provide her- 
 felf with fuf?icient neceffaries for the voyage, and 
 eight hundred more to Ic depofited in the hands of 
 the captain of the fhip, to be paid her on her arri- 
 val, with which fhe appeared very well fatisfied, 
 atid gave him the moft folemn riTurances never to 
 trouble him again. 
 
 But ivlifs Flora v/as all diftradlion at this event : 
 
 the thoughts of leavinG; dear London v.-ere e- 
 
 qually irkfome to her v/ith thofe of death itfi-lf .• — 
 
 fain would the have frayed behind ; but what could 
 
 fhe do? without reputation, — without friends, 
 
 Avithdut money, there was no reireJy but to 
 
 fliare her mother's fortune ; Mrs. Prinks alfo 
 
 wb.o, by living (o long with lady Mellafm, 
 
 known to be in all her fecrets, and agent in lier 
 
 iniquitous proceedings, could have no character to

 All Mr. Goodman's friends congratulated him 
 on the fcrvice he had done his country, in jiddinf^ it 
 oi three pcrfons, who, by perverting the talents 
 heaven had beftowtd upon them to the moil vile 
 purpoics, were capable of doing the greatefl mif-

 this occaiion, that he made the invitation bcfore-

 two Mr, Thoughtleffes, and Mrs. Munden : 
 
 the liufbai:d of that lady had alfo received an invita- 
 tion to be one of the giiefts, but he pretended a pre- 
 views engagement would not permit him to accept 
 tiie favour intended him. 
 
 Hc'made his excufe, however, in terms ^o polite,

 apprehcnfions that his abfence was occafioned by 
 any other motive, than what his mefT^ige had ex-

 Sir Ralph. Trufly and his lady, who were the on- 
 ly pcrfons who had the leaft fufpicion of the truth 
 cf this affair, could not help being a good deal con- 
 cerned at it ; but they forbore taking any notice

 terms : 
 
 ' * I fee plainly, my dear,' Lid flie, * through the

 f tily forry to find this frefli proof of the difunion

 ' * ry great alteration in his behaviour fhall oblige me 
 ' * to tiiink I ought, in gratitude, to make fume 
 ' * change in mine.' 
 
 Lady Trufty would not prolong the converfation 
 ' for fear of being obferved, and they .both rejoined 
 
 t tlie company. A.fter this, there pafTed nothing 
 
 of fufrxcient moment to acquaint the reader with,

 Lady Trufty was far from being forgetful of the

 This letter being fent pretty early in the morning, 
 Mr. Mii'den v/as but juft out of bed when he re- 
 ceived \\. : a breakfaft muchlefi pleafing to him 
 
 than his chcculate ; — he doubted not but his wife

 guelTed on what rv:ore he v/2« fcnt for in tills pref-

 difagreeable to him to ci:::jr into any dlfcufiions on 
 that head, it was fome tunc before he could refolve 
 within himfelf what anfv/er he fhould fend.

 But whatever deficiencies there nVight be in this 
 gentleman, none, excepting thofe of his own fami- 
 Jy, to whom he did not think it worth his while to 
 be coinplaifant, could ever accufe him of want of 
 
 politeiiefs. A charadxcr lb dear to him, that, 
 
 perhaps, he would not have forfeited it, even for 
 the attainment of any other of the more fliinlng and 
 valuable virtues of his fex. 
 
 Perplexing, therefore, as he knew this interview 
 mufl necefTarily be to him, he could not think of- 
 behaving in an uncourtly manner to a gentleman of 
 Sir Ralph Trufty's rank, and fortune ; and having 
 ordered that the fervant, who brought the letter, 
 fliould come up, defired him, in the mofl affable 
 terms, to acquaint his mafter, that nothing (hould 
 deprive him of the honour of attending him the mo- 
 ment he was d relied. 
 
 Sir Ralph l^ufty in his younger years had lived 
 very much in London,- -had kept the befl com- 
 pany in it, zVid though he v/as perfectly fincere in 
 his nature, and had a thorough contempt for all 
 thofc !„le fuperflucus ceremonies, which forae peo- 
 ple look upon as the height of good breeding, and 
 value themftlves fo much upon, yet he knew how 
 to put thci.i in practice whenever he found they 
 Would facilitate aiiy point he had to gain ; and as Air, 
 Muj'oen was akogcti^cr the courtier in his bthavi- 
 our, he thought it beft to addrefs him in his own 
 way, and receive him rather in a manner :.s if he was 
 about to praife him for feme laudable a6ti«n he had 
 done, than make any remonilrances to him, on a 
 conduct, vv/jich he wanted to convince him re- 
 quired fume aniendmei:it. 
 
 After having faid a great many obliging things to 
 him, in order- to bring him imo a humour proper 
 for bis pirrpofe, the politic old baronet began in 
 thtfe ternis to cpcn the builncfs, on which he had 
 dcfired to fpcak with him. 
 
 * I have

H8 The HISTORY of 
 
 ' I have not words to make you fenfible,' con- 
 tinued he, ' how much your abfcnce was regretted 
 yefterday by all the company at Mr. Goodman's, 
 
 * efpeciajly by the two Mr. Thoughtlefils^ who, 
 
 * indeed, on all accafions, exprefs the higheft efteeni 
 and regard for you, both as a friend and brother ; 
 
 ' but I was more particularly afFt6lc/J, when, on 
 
 * coming home, my wife acquainted me with what 
 
 * fhe imagined the real caufe that deprived us of 
 
 * you. 
 
 * She told me,' added he, ' that, having the 
 ■ other day furprifed Mrs. Mundcn in tears and 
 
 * great confufion, flie would not leave her till fhe 
 ^ wrelled from her a fecrct, which I am equally 
 
 * aftiamed and forry to repeat, but which you can 
 
 * be at no lofs to guefs at.' 
 
 Though Mr. Munden had forefeen on what ac- 
 count he was fcnt for, and had prepared himfclf for 
 it, yet he could not forbear teftifying feme confu- 
 fion ; but recovering himfelf from it as foon as he 
 
 could, « Yes, Sir Ralph, I eafily perceive,' 
 
 anfwered he, * tlut my wife has been making fom.e 
 
 * complaints againft me to your lady, which, doubt- 
 
 * lefs, ha-'e laid me under her difpleafure, as I 
 ' knov\^ the accufer has the advantage of the ac- 
 
 * cufed, in the opinion of thofe to whom they ap- 
 « peal.' 
 
 * Not at all,' cried Sir Ralph, haflily, * I dare 
 ' anfwer, that my wife is no lefs concerned for 
 
 * your fake, than for that of Pvlrs. Munden, at the 
 
 * unfortunate difagreement that has happened be- 
 
 * twecn you.' 
 
 As he was fpeaking thefe words, lady Trudy, 
 either by dcfign or accident, pafs'd by the door of 
 the room V here they were fitting. — ' Come in, 
 ' my dear,' faid Sir Ralph to her, ' andjuflify 
 
 * yourfelf from being fvvayed agnind right reufun, 
 
 * by any partial affection to your fair friend.' 
 

<#PG# 257>

 * If you mean in the cr-fe of Mrs. Munden, as 
 
 * I fuppofe ycu do,' replied {he, ' I can acquit 
 
 * myfclf vviih very great cafe from any imputation 
 
 * on that fcore, and am ready even before her huf • 
 
 * band to give it as my judgment, that in all dif- 
 
 * putes between pcrfons, wh^ are married to each 
 
 * other, efj^ccially when carried to any height,

 * one may be the firft aggreflor, the other feldom, 
 
 * if ever, behaves fo as not to incur feme part of 
 
 * thebl^me. 
 
 * Your ladyHiip is all goodnefs,' faid Mr. Mun- 
 den, very refpedtfully, * and in v.'hat you have faid, 
 
 * difcover hot only a penetration, but alfo a love of 
 
 * juftice, which can never be too much admired 
 
 * and applauded. " What your ladyihip has ob- 
 
 * ferved between me and Mrs. Munden, is ex- 
 
 * a6lly the thing ; it is certain, that both of us 
 
 * have been to blame ; 1 have, perhaps, a£^ed 
 
 * in a manner fomewhat too abruptly towards her, 
 
 * and {be in one too refentful, and too imperious 
 ' towards me; and though! am willing to allows 
 
 * my dear Betfy all the merit of thofe good qualities

 * to Zara in his Mourning Bride, and faying, 
 
 *' That fhe has paffion, which outftrip the 
 
 *' winds, 
 *' .And root her reafon up.' 
 
 Lady Trufly, who, for the fake of Mrs. Mun- 
 den's reputation, was fo eager to patch up a recon- 
 ciliation at any rate between her and her hufband, 
 would not fcem to defend her behaviour as a wife, 
 while {lie gtntly accufed him of having too far ex- 
 erted the authority of a hufoand. 
 
 In a word; both Sir Ralph, and his lady, ma- 
 naged in fo artful a manner, ftill blending cajolirgs 
 
 with 
 

<#PG# 258>
250 T'le HISTORY cf 
 
 with remonftrances, that when they came to enter 
 into a difcuflion on tliis affair, that Mr. Munden, 
 whatever he thought in his heart, could not forbear 
 fecming to yield to thejuftice of their reafonings.' 
 
 He confented, though not without fome fcruples, 
 and a much greater fnare of inward reludlance, than 
 his complaifance would permit Imn to make fliev/ of, 
 to add one guinea per week to his a'lowar.ce for the 
 expences of his table.' — ■ — As to the reft, he readi- 
 ly enough agreed to meet his wife half way towards 
 
 a reconciliation, affured them, that he was far 
 
 from requiring any other fubmiflion en her part, 
 than what he would fet her the example of in him- 
 felf, and that he wifhed nothing more than to ex- 
 change forgivencTs wit'i her. 
 
 On this, lady Trufiy difpatchcd a fervant dirctTtly 
 to Mrs. Munden, to let her know fl:!e muft needs 
 
 fpeak with her immediately ; which fummons 
 
 was no focner delivered, than complied with. 
 
 The prudent lady having caft about in her mind 
 all that was proper to be done, in order to accom- 
 plifh the good work fhe laboured for, and had {o 
 much at heart, would not leave it in the power of 
 chance to didippoint what £nc had fo happily begun, 
 and having prevailed over the ill-nature and four- 
 nefs of the hufband, thought it equally neceflary to 
 prevent the refentment, or inadvertency of the wife, 
 from fruflrating her endeavours. 
 
 On being told Mrs. Munden was come, (lie ran 
 
 down flairs to receive her, led her into a parlour, 
 
 and informedher, as bricfiv asdie could,aH tliat part, 
 which fhe thought would bemoft fatiofadory to her, 
 of the converfation which had paffed between thcni 
 and Mr. Munden, on her fcore. 
 
 Finding what fiie faid was received by the other 
 more cooly th.-^n (he wifhed, flie took that privilege, 
 wliich her rank, her age, and the friendfliip {l:se had 
 always (hewn to her, might juftly claim, to remon- 
 
 ftrate

 flrate to her, that it did not become her fituation and 
 charadler to lUnd too much upon pundtiliu's at this 
 
 time ; that all, that either was, or ought to be 
 
 dear to womankind, depended on a fpcedy accom- 
 
 mod.aion with her husband i ' The unhappy 
 
 ' brulco,' fdid (he, ' has lafted too long, your 
 
 * fervaiiti muft certainly know it,— -you cannot be 
 
 * allured of their fccrecy,---thc whole afFair, per- 
 
 * baps with large additions to it, will foon become 
 ' the talk of the town, ---every one will be def- 
 ' canting upon it, and how much foever Mr. Mun- 
 
 * den may be in fault, you cannot hope to efcape 
 
 * your own fnare in the cenfure.' 
 
 Poor Mrs. Munden, wlio locked upon this lady 
 as a Lcond mother, would not attempt to oixcr any 
 thing in oppofition to the arguments llie ufed ; and, 
 beildcs, could not forbear avuwing within heifelf the 
 juftice of them. — ' Well, madam,' anfvvered (he, 
 with a deep figh, * I fnall endeavour to foliovy 
 ' your ladyfhip's ad vie?, and, fmce I am a wife, 
 
 * will do ixiy befl: to make the yc ke, I have fub- 
 ' mitted to, fit as liglitly upon me as pofTible. 
 
 Lady Truity pe;ceivii;g her fpirits v/erc very much 
 dcprefied, cniirtcd nothing, tliat the fhortnefs of time 
 would allow, to perfuade her to believe, that her 
 condition was not fo unhappy, in reality, as {he at 
 prefent imagined it to be J and having brought her 
 to fomevv'hat of a more chearful temper, conducied 
 her into the room where Sir Ralph and Mr. IMun- 
 - den were {tiildiicourfing on the niatter in quel'tion. 
 * Welcome, my fair charge,' cried the former, 
 taking her by the hand, and drawing her towards 
 Mr. Munden, — ' I have once already had the ho- 
 ' nour of giving you to this gentleman, permit me 
 -' to do fo afecond time ; - ■ I hope, v.'ith the fan>e 
 
 * fatisfailion on both iidcs, as at firit.' 
 
 ' On mine, by heaven it is,' replied Mr. Mun- 
 den, flying haftily to embrace her, as fhe moved 
 
 /lov/ly 
 

<#PG# 260>
252 "Th H I S T O R Y of

 ' will be a fufticient fecurity for her, that 1 Ihall be 
 ' very careful fc-r the future, to avoid doing znf 
 
 * thing that may again fubjcit me to the like mis- 
 
 * fortune.' 
 
 Thefc words, and the tender air which he afTum- 
 ed in fpcaking them, were fo much beyond what 
 Airs. Mundcn could have expecfted from him, after 
 his late treatment of her, that all her pride, her an- 
 ger, and even her indifl'erence, fubfided at that in- 
 Ibnt, and gave place to fcntiments of the moil gen- 
 tle nature. 
 
 ' You may believe,' anfwered fhe, v/ith an infi- 
 nity of fweetnefs m her voice and eyes, * that I 
 
 * have alfo had my fliare of anguifh ; but v/hatever 
 
 * inquietudes you have fuftained en my account mud 
 ' be forgotten on your part, as it fliall be mine to 
 
 * make attonement fur tliem, by every thing in my 
 ' power, which can flatter me with the hopes of 
 
 * doing fo.' 
 
 Infenfibie and morofe'as Mr. Mnnden was, he 
 could not avoid, on this ob'i2:ing behaviour in his 
 fair wife, being touched in reality with fome foft e- 
 motions, which he fo well knew how to magnify the 
 appearanceof, thatno. only herfelf, buttheby-flanders, 
 imagined he was the moit tranfported man alive. 
 
 Injooflible is it to exprefs how much Sir Ralph, 
 and his good lady, rejoiced to fee this happy eve'zit : 
 — ihey entertaiiied them very elegantly at dinner, — 
 in the afternoon they went all together to take the 
 air in Kenfington gardens, 'and a great deal of 
 company coming in the evening to vifit lady Trufty, 
 every tiling contributed to keep up the fpirit and 
 good humour of the newly re- united pair.

 She had not, however, any frefli motive to re- 
 
 trrct their departure on this account; Mr. Mun-

 aiianner as he had done fince the breach had been

 Jher civilly v;hen with her, the little flie enjoyed of 
 his company was no manner of afflidlion to her. 
 
 She itill refirained fonie part of that gaiety and

 But I fhall not expatiate on their prefent manner 
 t>f behaviour to each other, fmce it v/as not of any 
 Jong continuance, but proceed to the recital of a 
 little adventure, which, the' it may feem trifling to 
 the reader in the repetition, will hereafter be found 
 of fome confequence. 
 
 It was a mighty cuftom with lady Mellafin and 
 Mifs Flora, when they had nothing of more confe- 
 quence to entertain them, to go among the fliops, 
 and amufe themfelves Vv-ith enquiring after newLilhl- 
 ons, and looking over that variety of merchandize, 
 which is daily brought to this great mart of vanity 
 and luxury.' 
 
 Mrs. Munden, while In a virgin ftate, and a^ 
 boarder at Mr. Goodman's, ufcd frequently to ac- 
 
 ■ company thofe ladies, when bent on fuch fort of 
 rambles, and {he ftill was fond enough of fatisfying; 
 her curiofity this way, at fuch times as (lie found 
 nothing elfe to do, or was not in a humour to give, 
 
 I or receive vifits. 
 
 . Happening one day to pafs by the well-furnifhed 
 ! (hop of an eminent mercer, and feeing feveral filks 
 ' lye fpread upon the counter, fhe was tempted to 
 ) Itep in, ai;d examine them more nearly. A great 
 
 ■ luimber of others were alfo taken from the fhelves, 
 I. and laid before her ; but f}:ie not feeming to approve 
 . a^iy of them; the mercer told her he had fome cu- 
 ;■ rious pieces out of the loom that morning of ? quite 
 
 new pattern, which he had fent his m.an with to a 
 lady of quality, and expected he would be back in 
 
 1; a few minutes, fo intreated flie would be pleafed ei- 
 ther to flay a little, or give him directions where (he. 
 might be waited upon. 
 
 Mrs. Tvlunden complied with the former of thefe 
 requcfts, and the ratlier becaufe, while they were 
 teiking, (iie hard from a parlour behind the (hop a

 harpfichord very finely touched, accompanied with 
 a kmale voice, which Tung in the nioft harmonious 
 accents, part of this air, compofed by the celebrated 
 Jiigiiior iiononcini : 
 
 " M'infegna I'amor I'inganno, 
 " Mi togl'al cor, I'afFanno, 
 *' Mi da I'ardir amor, 
 '< Mi da I'ardir amor." 
 
 7'he attention Mrs. Munden gave to the mufick, 
 prcvciVting her from fpeaking, the mercer faid he was 
 i'orry ilic was obliged to wait fo long ; — —** I ra- 
 " theroug'it to thank you Sir, for detaining me, fince 
 " I have here an entertainment more elegant than 
 *' I could have expedled elfewhere." 
 
 " Tlie lady fings and plays v/ell indeed, madam," 
 /aid he ; " fhe is a cuftomer of mine, and fomc- 
 " limes docs my wife the favour of paffing an hour 
 *' with her." 
 
 The lady flill continued playing, and Mrs. Mun- 
 den exprefTing a more than ordinary pleafure in hcar- 
 jag her, the complaifant mercer asked her to walk 
 inu) the pailaur \ to which fhe replied, (lie would 
 gladly accept his offer, provided It would be no in- 
 trufion ; he afiured her it would not be accounted 
 -jo in the leafl, and with thefe words condudted her 
 iiuu the room. 
 
 A few words f.^rved to introduce her io his wife, 
 \Vho being a very genteel, pretty fort of a v;oman, 
 received her with great civility ; but the fair mufici- 
 <?n was no fooner told the effe£l her accents had ■ 
 produced on Mrs. Munden, than tho' flie was a 
 joreigner, and fpoke very broken englifli, fhe return- 
 ed the compliment made her by that lady on the 
 cccalion, in a manner fo perfecStly free, and withal 
 fo noble, as difcovered her to have been bred among, 
 and accuftomed to converfe with perfons in the 
 hi^eii ilations in life.

 Vain as Mrs. Munden was of her perfections, 
 flic was alwavs ready to acknowledge, and admire 
 thofe file found in others of her fex. There was 
 •fomcthing in this lady that attracted her in a pecu- 
 liar jiianncr ; fhe took as much delight in hearing 
 her talk, as {he had done in hearing her fing ; fiie 
 longed to be of the number of her acquaintance, 
 and made her feveral overtures that way, which the 
 other either did not, or would notfeem tounderftand. 
 
 The mercer's man returning with the filks his 
 mafter had mentioricd, Mrs. Munden thought, 
 after the obliging entertainment fhe had received, 
 flie could do no lefs than become a purchafer of 
 fomething; accordingly fhe bought a piece of filk for 
 a night-gown, though at that time fhe had not the 
 leaft occtifion for it, nor on her coming into the 
 fhop had any intention to increafe her wardrobe. 
 
 Having now no longer a pretence to ftay, fhe 
 gave the mercer dire£lions where to fend home the 
 fiik, and then took her leave ; but could not do it 
 without telling the lady, that fhe fliould think her*- 
 felf extremely happy in having the opportunity of a 
 much longer converfation with her. 
 
 On her fpeaking in this manner, the other ap- 
 peared in very great confufion ; but having, after a 
 pretty long pauie, a little recovered herfelf, " It is. 
 " an honour, madam," faiJ flie, '* I would be 
 " extremely ambitious of, and had certainly taken 
 " the liberty to requefi: it of you, if there were not 
 " a cruel peculiarity in my fate, which deprives 
 " me of all hopes of that, and mang^ other bleffings 
 " I could v/ifh to enjoy." 
 
 Mrs. Munden was fo much furprized at thefs 
 words, that file could only reply, fhe was forry a- 
 lady, v/ho appeared fo deferving, fhould be denied 
 any thing (lie thought worthy of deferving.

 have any motive to induce her to fpeak in the terms 
 flic had done. Mrs. Munden had a good deal of 
 curiofuy in her compofition, fVie thought there wa4 
 fjmething extraordinarily myfterious in the circum- 
 flancei ot this ftranger, and was very defirous of 
 penetrating into the fecret. 
 
 About an hour afcer file came home, the mer- 
 cer's man brought home the fiik : fne enquired of 
 h'm the name, condition, arid place of abode of the 
 young lady flie had ficn at his mailer's, but re- 
 ceived not the Icafi: information from him to any of i 
 the queftions fhe had put to him. He told her, ' 
 that though fhe often bought things at their (hop, 
 yet his ma'' er always canicd them home himfclf, 
 arx] he was intin ly ignorant of every thing relating 
 ti lier, 
 
 l^his a little vexed her, becaufe (he doubted not 
 but that if flie once found out her name, quality, 
 and where fi^.' lived, her invention would fupply 
 her with the mcansof making a more particular dif- 
 covery. She relujved, therefore, on going again 
 to th^ Ihop, under the pretence of buying fomething, 
 and afking the mercer himfelf, v,'ho fhe could not 
 im.unne would have any intertft in concealing what 
 fhe deflrcd to know. 
 
 Some company coming in, prevented her from 
 going that afternoon ; hut fhe went the next morn- 
 ing after breakfaft. 7'he mercer not happening to 
 be at home, flie was more than once tempted by 
 her impatience to adc for his wife, and as often re- 
 lirained by thereflc61ion, that fuch a thing miight be 
 looked upon as a piece of impertinence in a perfon . 
 fo much a ftranger : {he left the houfe without fpeak- 
 ing to anybody but themanfhehadfeen theday before. 
 
 Her curiofuy, however, would not perhaps have 
 fufFered her to ftop here, if fumething of more mo- 
 ment had not fallen out to engage her attention, 
 and put the other ©ut of her head for ;he prefent.

 The nobleman on whom Mr. Munden depended 
 for the gift fo often mentioned in this hiftory, had 
 l^en a long time out of town, and was but lately 
 returned. He had heard in the country that Mr. 
 Munden was married," and that his wiie was very 
 beautiful and accompliftied. 
 
 On Mr. Munden's going to pay his compliments 
 
 to him on his arrival, " I congratulate you," 
 
 faid he ; " I am told you are married, and 
 
 *' have got one of the prcttieft and moft aaiiable 
 *' women in London for a wife." 
 
 *' As to beauty my lord," replied he, " there Is 
 *' no certain flandaid for it, and I am intirely cf 
 ** the poet's mind, that 
 
 " 'Tis in no face, but in the lover's eye.'*. 
 
 . *' But whatever fhe is." continued he, *' lam 
 *' afraid flie would be too vain if {he knew the ho- 
 *' nour your lordfliip docs her, in making this fa- 
 *' vourable mention of her." 
 
 *' Not at all," rejoined the peer, *' butlfhall 
 *' not take her character from common fame ; — ► 
 *' you mufi give me leave to be a judge of the per- 
 ." fedions I have heard fo much talk cf j" bcfides, 
 purfued he, " I have a mind to fee what fort of a 
 
 *' houfe you keep ; 1 think I will come fome 
 
 *' day and take a dinner with yuu." 
 
 It is not to be doubted, but that Mr. Munden 
 omitted nothing that might afture his lordiJiip, that 
 it was an honour that he wa^. extremely ambitious of, 
 and fcould be equally proud of receiving, though 
 he durll not have preiuirted to have ffkcu it. 
 
 The very next day bang appoini.u for this grand 
 vifit, he v/ent home to liis wife, trnnfportcd with 
 the gracious behaviour ct his patron towards him. 
 He threw a large parcel of guineas iRto, her lap, ffnd 
 charged her to fpare nothii)g. that might, exjtortain

 and the favours he expeded one day to receive from

 Mr. Munden could not have given any com- 
 mands that would be more pleafing to his fair v^ife. 
 — — Feafting and grand company were her delight. 
 She fet about making the neceffary preparations with 
 the greateft alacrity imaginable ; and it muft be 
 acknowledged, that confidering the fhortnefs of the 
 time, (he had fufficient to have employed the mofl

 Is only the prelude to greater matters. 
 
 T might jiiftly be reckoned a piece of imperti- 
 nence to take up the reader's time with a repe- 
 tition of the biil of fare of the entertainment made 
 on the above-mentioned cccafion ; it will be fufii- 
 cient to fay, that every thing was extremely ele- 
 gant ; that it was compofed of the bcft chofen diflies, 
 which were all ferved up in the greateft order ; and 
 that there was as great a variety of them as confided 
 •with the table cf a private gentleman, without in- 
 curring the cenfure of profufenefs^. 
 
 Such as it was, however, the nobie lord Teemed 
 highly delighted with it ; he praifed every thing thar 
 came before him almoft to a degree of flattery, and 
 took all opportunities of being yet more lavifli in hi^ 
 encomiums on the beauty, wit, and elegance of the 
 fair provider, 
 
 Mr, Munden was tranfported within himfelfat" 
 the fatisfaiStion his patron exprefil'd, and his wife 
 alfo felt a fecret joy on hearing the fine tilings faid 
 of her, which fparkled in her eyes, and gave an 
 additional luftre to a]} her charms. 
 
 This nobleman, though paft what is called the 
 grime of lii^^ was far from having arrived at tlioJb

 year's, which bring on decay ; he was befides 
 
 of a fanguine vigorous complcilion — had a very 
 graceful perfon a fine addrefs— — a great afflu- 
 ence of wit, and fomething fo foft and engaging in 
 his manner of behaviour to the ladies, as rendered 
 him ftill a prodigious favourite with them. 
 
 He was too good a judge of what is amiable in 
 womankind, not to difcover immediately the many 
 
 perfe(ftions Mrs. Munden was miftrefs of ; he 
 
 fek the whole force of her charms, and as he loved 
 beauty more for his own f^^ke than for that of the 
 pofll'llbr, and never liked without defiring to enjoy, 
 his eyes told her at every glance, that he languifhed 
 for an opportunity of declaring in a different man- 
 lier the fentiments he had for her. 
 
 Mrs. Munden p^^rfe^ftly underftood the language 
 in which flie found herfclf ad'dreffed ; but had fhe 
 been lefs learned in it, an explanation foon prefcnt- 
 ed itfelf. Her hufband flepping to the head of the 
 flair-cafe to give fome orders to a fervant, the peer 
 took held of one of her hands, and kifling it with- 
 the utmoll raptures, * Divine creature,' crie<i he, 
 *howunjuftis fortune, that a face and perfon ior 
 * formed for univerfal adoration is not placed ina^ 
 '•higher, and more confpicuous fphere of life !' 
 
 She had not time to make any reply, > .Mr. 
 
 AJunden returned that moment; — nor had the no- 
 ble lord tlie jeall opportunity while he flayed of 
 rpeaking one word to her, that was improper for a 
 huil)3nd to be witncfs of. 
 
 He prolonged the time of his departure to a grea- 
 ter length than could have been expe<?i:cd from a 
 perfon, whofe high office in the flate permitted him 
 much fewer hours of leifure, than thofe in mid- 
 dling ftations of life are happy enough to enjoy : 
 " -Vv'hen he went away he affured both the hus- 
 band and ths wife, that he quitted them with the

26z The HISTORY cf 
 
 utmofl: reluiStance, and that he had never paft a day ■ 
 more agreeably in his whole life. 
 
 Mr. Mundcn was now infuch high good humotr, 
 that he no fooner found himfelf alone with his fair 
 wife, than he took her in his arn^.s, and kified her 
 very heartily :— — a favour not common with him 
 
 fince the firft week of their marriage. He told 
 
 her moreover (he had behaved that day like an an-- 
 
 gel,' that nothing could be more elegant than tlie 
 
 dinner fhe had prepared, and that he could not 
 have expciSted fuch a variety of covers ; and (o 
 fine a deiert for the money he gave her for that 
 purpofe. 
 
 ' I think myfelf very happy,* anfwcrcd fiie, 
 
 * that you approve fo well of my management^ 
 
 * but I fancy,' continued (lie, with a fmile, ' you 
 ' will have fome better opinion of my ceconomy,, 
 ' when 1 fliall tell you, that it coft lefs than you 
 
 * imagine.' 
 
 * Is it poiTible !' cried he, in a plcafing furprife i 
 
 * I rather thought you had been kind enough to 
 
 * have added fomewhat out of your own pocket, 
 ' to render the entertainment lb perfectly com- 
 ' pleat.' 
 
 * No, I affure you,' refumed fhe, * there re- 
 
 * mains no lefs than thefe three guineas of the fum 
 ' you allowed me for this day's expence.' — With 
 thefe words, Ihe laid the pieces fhe had mentioned 
 on the table ; which he was fo ungenerous as 
 to take immediately up, and put into Ills own 
 pocket. 
 
 Nay, Mr. Mundcn,' faid fhe, while he was put- 
 ting up the money,— ' this is not dealing altoge-- 
 
 '- ther fo fairly by me, as I have done by you : — I 
 ' expeded, that the trouble I have been at, defcrv- 
 "' cd at leafc to be rewarded with what I have faved. 
 
 * by my frugality.

 * Take care, my dear,' replied he laughing, 
 
 * how you lefTen the merit of what you have 
 
 * done,— —I am willing to take it as an obligation 
 y^ to me, and fure you value an obligation to meat 
 
 * a much higher rate than three pieces.' 
 Tiiough all this paiTed on botli fides in a jocofe 
 
 way, yet as it ferved to fhew the niggardlinefs of 
 .Mr. Mundeii's temper, cannot be fuppofed to have 
 increafed either the love, or refpe6x his wife had for 
 him. 
 
 She made however no other anfv/er to what he 
 had laft faid, than to tell him that fhe found he 
 was fadiionable enough to fuffer virtue to be its own 
 reward, and then turned the converfation, and con- 
 tinued in the fame chearful humour as before any 
 mention had been made of the three guineas :• 
 Mr. Mundcn did not go abroad the whole evening, 
 but whether he cl"!ofe to fup at home, for the plea- 
 fure of enjojing his wife's company, or for the 
 fake of re- partaking the remainder of thofe dain- 
 ties, which had been {o highly praifed at dinner, 
 is a point, which perhaps might admit Qf fome dif- 
 pute. 
 
 It is certain, indeed, the yet unfubducd vanity of 
 this )oung lady, made her feel ^o much iimate fa- 
 tisfadion in the admiration their noble vifiter had 
 exprefled of her perf n and acccmpHfiiments, as 
 gave a double fprightlincfs to her convcrfation 
 that whole evening, and might perhaps render her 
 more than ordinarily lovely^ in the eyes of her 
 hufband. 
 
 It is very far from being an im.probability, that 
 fome people may be apt to imagii;;e fhe built a little 
 too much on the veracity of the praifus btflowed 
 upon her by that nobleman ; but thofa, who think 
 this way, will be convinced of their error, v/hen 
 tliey will prefently find hovv' far her conjedurcs were 
 juftified in this point. 
 
 She

 She was fitting the next mornmg in a carelefs po- 
 ' fture at one of the windows that looked into the 
 ilreet, ruminating fometimes on one thing, and 
 -fometimes on another ; when fhe could not help 
 obferving a fellow on the other fide of the way, 
 who kept walking backwards and forvv'ards before 
 the houfe, which though he frequently paft thirty 
 ■or forty paces, yet he took care never to lofe fight 
 •of. 
 
 This feeraed a little odd to her, as (he fat there 
 a confiderable time, and the man ftill continued on 
 his poR : — .—fhe doubted not but that he wanted to 
 fpeak with fome one or other of her family, but 
 had not the lealt notion his bufinefs was with her- 
 fclf. 
 
 Being told breakfafl waited for her, fhe went in- 
 to her dreffing room, where fhe ufually took it, and 
 thought no further of the man, till Mr. Munden 
 was dreifed and gone out, but in lefs than a minute 
 ^fter he was fo, fhe received intelligence from her 
 footman, and there was a perfon had a letter for 
 her, and faid he would deliver it into no hands but 
 her own. 
 
 On this fhe ran immediately down flairs, and 
 found to her great furprife, that he was no other 
 than the fellow, that file had feen loitering fo 
 long about the houfe. — ' I am ordered, madam,' 
 ^ faid he, * to give you this,' and at the fame time 
 prefented her with a letter : • — ' From whom does 
 ' it come ?' demanded (lie : ' I am ignorant,' an- 
 fvvered he, * both of the perfon who ftnt it, and 
 -.s.* the bufinefs it contains :---my ordeis were on- 
 * ly to deliver it into your own hands;' and 
 with thefe words went away with all the fpeed he 
 could. 
 
 It mud he confeflld a married woman ought not 
 to have received a letter brought her in this mann'cr, 
 and without knowing Vi'hea<;c it ca^aie, but curiofity

 port of it : -= — ftie doubted not one moment, but 
 that it was diflated by the noble lord fhe had fecn 
 the day before, and whofe behaviour to her had in 
 fome degree coirefpondeJ v/ith the fentiments con- 
 tained in it. If her vanity was delighted with 
 
 the conqueil: fhe had made ; her piide was fiiock- 
 cd at that aiTurance, which the daring lover feemed 
 to flatter himfcif with of gaining her, and her vir- 
 tue much more alarmed at the attempts, which his 
 rank and fortune might embolden him to make for 
 that end. 
 
 At firft fhe was refolved to fhew the letter to 
 her hufband the moment he came home, and ac- 
 quaint him with her fentiments on the matter, that 
 he might take proper precautions to prevent her 
 from being expofed to any future attacks from this 
 dangerous nobleman. 
 
 But on more mature deliberation, her mind 
 changed : Mr. Munden was at prefent in tole- 
 rable good humour with her ; fhe was willing 
 
 if pofTible to preferve it in him, and as ihe could not 
 but think an information of this kind would give him 
 z great deal of uneafmefs, fo (lie had alfo reafon to 
 iipprchcnd thecfFciis of it might in fome meafure, 
 innocent as fhe was, fall upon herfelf. 
 
 He had never yet dilcovcred the leafl: emotions of

l6^ 7he^ HISTORY of 
 
 after, {he might have faved herfelf a very great 
 ihock, and her hufband much vexation. 
 
 It was no more than three days after the great 
 man had dined there, that Mr. Munden received 
 a billet from him, which contained as follows : 
 
 To George Munden, Efq;; 
 
 ' ' Dear Munden^ 
 
 *'' T Have fo few days that I can call my own, 
 
 " i. that I am willing to make thofe (tw as 
 
 " happy as I can, and on that motive defire 
 
 *'■ your's, and your amiable wife's company to 
 
 *' dinner v/ith me to-morrow ; 1 leave you 
 
 ** to make both my requeft and compliments ac- 
 
 •* ceptable to her, and am, 
 
 " With all fmcerity, 
 
 *' Dear Munden, 
 
 '* Your's, &c. &c. 
 
 « * * * '»■ 
 
 *' P. S', I fh::ll have a female relation with me, 
 
 *' who will rejoice in an opportunity ofbecom- 
 
 " ing acquainted with Mrs. Munden. "^ 
 
 Mr. Munden defired the fervant, who brought 
 
 this, to give his own and wife^s moft humble duty 
 
 to his lord, and afllire his lordfhip, they would. 
 
 not fail to attend his commands. 
 
 Some friends being with him, v/hen this invi- 
 tation was brought, hindered him from faying any 
 thing of ft at that time to his wife, but they were 
 i\o fooner gone, than with an air and voice elated 
 even to an excefs, he told her of the high fa- 
 vour conferred upon them by his right honoura- 
 ble patron. 
 
 Mrs. Munden was now more than ever con- 
 vinced of the bafedefigns lord * * * * had upon 
 her, and that the letter (he had received was fent 
 hy him :— fhe therefore immediately determined 
 v.ithin herfelf to let him fee, by her not complying 
 with this invitation, that Hie was neither ignorant 
 
 what 
 

<#PG# 277>
Mffs Betsy THOUcifPLESs. 269 
 
 what his intentions were, nor would do any thing 
 that might give him the leaft encouragement to 
 profecute them. 
 
 But as (he ftill judged it was wholly improper 
 to acquaint Mr. Munden with any thing of the 
 affair, (he could form no other contrivance to a- 
 void accompanying him in thisvifit, than by pre- 
 tending herfeif feized with a fudden indifpofition, 
 which (he refolved to do fome few hours before the 
 arrival of that wherein they fhould fet out. 
 
 If (lie had perfided in this mind, it would have 
 been highly laudable indeed ; — but, al s! the next 
 morning infpired her with very different fenti- 
 ments ; — vanity, that fly f'ubverter of our bed: 
 refolutions, fuggefted to her, that there was no 
 neceflity for her behaving in the manner fhe had 
 defigned. 
 
 * What (hould I fear .?' faid fhe to herfeif, 
 ' what danger threatens either my virtue, or my 
 
 * reputation. — A wife may certainly go any where 
 ' with her hufband, befides, a lady will be there, 
 
 * — a relation of his lordfhip's, — he can commu- 
 ' nicate nothing to me in their prefence, that 
 
 * I (hould blufh to hear, and it would be rather 
 ' ridiculous prudery than difcretion in me, to 
 ' deny myfelf the fatisfadlion of fuch good com- 
 
 * pany.* 
 
 $? It mart be acknowledged, for it but too plainly 
 appears from every circumftance of this lady's con- 
 duifl both before and after marriag?, that the un- 
 happy propenllty in her nature, for attrafting uni- 
 verfal admiration, rendered her little regardful ei- 
 ther of the guilt, or the difquiets tj which hei 
 beauty was accefTory : — if fhe was admired ani 
 loved, (he cared not to what end ;— in fine, it 
 made her perfectly uncorrupt and pure, as her own 
 inclinations were, rather triumph in than regret 
 the power ihe had of infpiring the moft inordinate 
 and vicious ones in others. Aa 3 Thus

 Thus, more delighted than alarmed, (he c- 
 qulp'd herfelf with all the arts and labour'd induftry 
 of female pride, for fecuring the conqueft {he had 
 gained ^--fafe as fhe imagined herfelf from all 
 the encroachments of prefumptuous love, {lie 
 pleafed herfelf with the thoughts of being looked 
 upon by the adoring peer, as Adam did upon the 
 forbidden fruit j— longing, wilhing, but not daring 
 to approach. 
 
 She had but jufl: flnifhed her embelli{hments, 
 and was looking in the great glafs to fee if all was 
 right, when Mr. Mundcn fcnt up {lairs to know 
 if (he was ready, and to tell her his noble patron 
 had fent his own chariot to fetch them : — on 
 hearing this, {he immediately tript down {lairs^ 
 itnf^ing 23 flie went this part of an old fong. 
 With an air, and a face,. 
 And a ihape and a grace, 
 
 Let me charm like Beauty's goddefs. 
 
 Oh, how will the prudent, referved part of tile- 
 fex lament, that a young lady,, endowed with fa 
 many perfe£iions, fo many amiable qualities, 
 fliould thus perfevcre in a vanity, of which {he 
 had already experienced fuch vexatious confe- 
 quences. 
 
 Lord **** received them in a fafbion, whicb 
 fully gratified the ambition of Mr. Munden, and 
 the yet lefs warrantable expeftations of his wife :-- 
 the lady mentioned in the letter, was already with 
 him, who, on his lordfliip's prefenting Mrs. Mun- 
 den to her, faluted her with abundance of fweet- 
 nefs and good breeding ;— -{he was a perfon of 
 about thirty years of age ; had been extremely 
 handfome, a-nd Itill retained the remain3 of charms,., 
 which mull have been very powerful in their 
 bloom ;---nor was her converfation \di agreeable 
 than her perfon ;---fhe fakl little indeed, but what 
 Ihe {aid V/3S extremdy to the purpofc, and very 
 
 enteitaioins :

 ftntertaining :— there was notwithftanding a cer- 
 tain air of melancholy about her, which fhe in 
 vain attempted to conceal, tho' it was eafy to per- 
 ceive (he made ufe of her utmoft eftbrts for that 
 purpofe* 
 
 His lordfliip was extreraefy gay and fpiiitous^ 
 as indeed were all the company, during the whole 
 time at dinner ; but it was no iboner over than 
 he faid to Mr. Munden,— * dear Munden I have 
 
 * a bufinefs to communicate to you, which thefe 
 
 * ladies muft forgive m^ if I make a fecret of to 
 ^ them i'---with thefe words he took Mr. Mun- 
 den into another room, and fpoke to him in the 
 following manner r 
 
 ' A perfon,*" faid he, ' has been guilty of ari 
 
 * action in regard to m«, which it is neither con- 
 ' fiflent with my honour, or my humour to put 
 ' up with f-— I will (hew you,' continued he, 
 giving hLm an unfealed letter, ' what I have wrote 
 *■ to him upon the occafion, and that will inftru6t 
 
 * you how I intend to proceed, and at the fame 
 ^ time convince you of the confidence I repofe in 
 
 * your friendfhip for me.' 
 
 Mr. Munden took the letter out of his lord- 
 ihip's hands, and found the contents as follov/. 
 
 To William- W ■-, Efq; 
 
 " Sir, 
 «t ^-g-^Hough the affront you have offered me.

 *' accompany me. 
 
 *' Not that I mean our friends fhould be en- 
 " gaged in the quarrel, but. think it proper, that 
 '' there fhould be fome witnefTes, that no foul 
 " play is attempted on either fide.---! am, 
 ** ExpetStJng your ready compliance, 
 > *' Sir, 
 
 " Yours, &c. 
 
 * You fee, Mundcn,' faid he, perceiving he 
 had done reading, * the aflurance I build on the 
 ' fincerity of your attachment to me.' ' Your 
 ' lordfhip does me an infinity of honour,' replied 
 the other with a low bow, * and I have nothing 
 
 * to regret, but that my fword muft lie idle while 
 ' your lordihip's is employed.' 
 
 ' As for that,'-refumed the peer, * I always 
 
 * thought it the utmoft folly and injuftice to fet 
 
 * two people on cutting one another's throats, 
 
 * meerly in compliment to their friends :---but 
 
 * my dear Munden,'—- purfued he, looking on 
 his watch ; * I would have you go immediately ; 
 
 * --- I believe you will find him at the Cocoa- 
 ' tree; he is generally there about this hour,--- 
 
 * but if not, they will direit you where to find 
 
 * him.' 
 
 He fealed the letter while he was fpeaking, 
 which being again delivered to Mr. Munden, they 
 both returned into the room where the ladies 
 were.— Mr. Munden llayed no longer than while 
 his footman called a h.ickney-coach to the door; 
 as he was going out the nobleman faid to him, I 
 doubt not but you will be back as foon as pofTible, 
 in the mean time we three will amufe ourfelves 
 with a game at ombre. 
 
 Mrs, Munden was a good deal furprifed at her

 ))u{I)and^s departure, but had much more reafoit 
 to be ioy as well as alarmed, in a moment or two 
 after. 
 
 Cards were but juft laid upon the table, when- 
 a fervant came haftily, and told the lady a mef- 
 fenger had brought word that her mother was 
 fuddenly feized with an apopledlic fit ;---that it 
 was not yet known whether the old lady would 
 recover, and that fhe muft come home that in- 
 ftanr. 
 
 On this fhe ftarted up, fecmed in a moft terri- 
 ble fright, and took her leave with a precipitatioa 
 natural enough to the occafion, in a daughter pof- 
 fefled of any (hare of duty orafFc£lion. 
 
 This part of the hiftory muft be very unintel- 
 ligible indeed, if the reader has not by this time 
 feen, that all this was but a feint contrived by the 
 amorous nobleman, in order to get an opportunity 
 of employing the whole battery of his rhetoric 
 againft th€ virtue he was impatient to triumph 
 over. 
 
 This pretended kinfwoman was in fa<3:, no 
 more thana caft-off miftrefs of his lordfhip's, but 
 having her dependance entirely upon him, was 
 obliged to fubmit in every thing to his will, and 
 become an affiftant to thofe pleafures with others, 
 which {he no longer could afford him in her own 
 perfon. 
 
 She was brought to his houfc that day for two 
 reafons, — firft, as he knew not what fears, and 
 what apprehenfions the beauty of Mrs. Munden 
 might raifc in her hufband, and render him fuf- 
 picious of the true motive of his being fent away, 
 had no other company been there ; and fecondly 
 to prevent that fair intended vi»5tlm of his unwar- 
 rantable fJame, from being too fuddenly alarmed 
 at finding herfclf alone with him.

 in the tioufe, and wholly in the power of a ptrfon, 
 who had deiigns upon her, to Vv'hich neither her 
 honour, nor her inclinations would permit her to 
 acquiefce, and trembled for the event, . but con- 
 cealing the diforders of her mind as much as poffi- 
 b!e :- - ' Well my lord,'-- faid flie, taking up the 
 cards, and beginiung to fliuflle them, ' fince we 
 
 * are deprived of a third perfon by this melancholy 
 
 * accident, what think your lordfliip of a game at 
 
 * p'quet.* 
 ' I think,' anfwcrcd he, looking upon her with 
 
 eyes, v;hich redoubled all her terrors ; ' that to 
 
 ' waflethe precious time in cards, and throw away 
 
 * the golden opportunity of telling you how much i 
 
 * my foul adores you, would-be a flupidity, which ? 
 
 * neither love, nor fortune could forgive me for.' 
 In fpeaking thefe words he fnatched one of her 
 
 hands, and infpiie of her endeavours to withdraw it, 
 ■prcfleditto his mouth with an eagernefs, which 
 would have convinced her, if fne had not been fo 
 before, of the vehemence of thofe defires with 
 which he was inflamed. 
 
 Fie my Lord,' cried (he, with an air as haughty 
 and referved as it was in the power of any woman 
 to affume, * this is not language with which the 
 ** wife of him you are pleafed to call your friend, 
 *' could expeil to be entertained.' 
 
 ' Unreafonably urged,' cried he : * Ought my 
 ' friendfhip to the husband render me infenfible of 
 
 * the beauties of the wife ? Or would your gene- 
 ' rous confenting to reward my paflion dillolve the 
 
 * union'between us P—no, on the contrary, it would 
 ' rather be cemented ; — I (hould then love him not

 nefs of your husband, and eftablifii his future foi-

 Thefe words, joined to Mr. Munden's being gone 
 i away (he knew not on what errand, made her fhud- 
 der with t-he apprehenfions, that he might have been 
 tempted by the hopes of intereft to become yielding 
 to the difhonourable intentions of his patron ;■ 
 but willing to be more confirmed ; ' I hope my 
 
 * lord,' anfwered flie, ' that you cannot think Mr, 
 
 * Mundeii has (o mean a foul as to accept of an

 * * I could name fome hufbands, and thofe of the

 It was the difcompofure of Mrs. Munden's mind^

 Lord **** finding he had to do with a niifirefs of. 
 uncommon fpirit, thought beft to alter the manner 
 of his addrefTes to her, and approaching her with 
 an air much more humble and i'ubmifTive than he 
 had hitherto done;--' how I adore,' cried he, ' this 
 
 * noble difintereftednefs in you ;— you will grant-

 * ty is indeed above all other price.— Let your huf-

 Perceiving, or at leaft imagining he perceived 
 
 fome abatement in the fiercenefs of her eyes, on 
 the change of his deportment, he perfifted in it,— 
 he even threw himfelf on his knees before her ; — 
 took hold of her hands ; bathed them alternate- 
 ly with tears, then dried them with his kilTes ; — in 
 fine, he omitted nothing that the mofl pafTionate love, 
 refolute to accomplifh its gratification, could fuggefl: 
 to foften her into compliance. 
 
 At another time, how would the vanity of this 
 lady have been elated to fee a perfon of fuch high 
 confideration in the world, thus proftrate at her feet ; 
 but at this, the refledion how much flie was in his 
 power, and the uncertainty how far he might ex- 
 ert that power, put to filence all the dictates of her 
 pride, and rendered her, in reality, much more \n 
 
 awe of him than be afFe<^ed to be of her : flie 
 
 turned her eyes continually towards the door, in 
 hopes of feeing Mr. Munden enter ; and never had

 fubjc6l or other of converfation, which, how fri- 
 volous foever, Mr. Munden could not break off 
 too fuddenly without incurring cenfure of abrupt- 
 nefs, and ill manners. 
 
 Lord **** in the mean time was in the utmoll 
 agitation j- — not for the return of Mr. Munden,- 
 for he very well knew the meflage he would 
 bring, hut he had taken a great deal ot pams to 
 no purpofe : — ■- the beauty of Mrs. Munden had 
 infpired him with the molt eager defire of enjoy- 
 ing her 3—— the gaiety of her temper, joined to 
 the temptations in his power to offer, had given 
 him an almoft affured hope of gaining her 5 — 
 and now to find himlelfthus repuUed, — repulied 
 with luch difdain, left a furprize upon him which 
 very much increaled the fliock of his difappoint-

 Befides, as he doubted not but !he would inform 
 her husband of all that had paflfed between them, 
 it gave the moll mortal ftab to that haughtinels 
 too incident to opulence and grandeur, to refledt 
 he had given a man (o much beneath him, an op- 
 portunity of triumphing over him in his mind. 
 
 He had not recovered his confufion, and was 
 walking backwards and forwards in his drawing- 
 room, with a difordered motion, when Mr. Mun- 
 den returned, to whom he neither fpoke, nor 
 bok'd upon. The fatisfaftion this gentleman had 
 felt on finding thebultnels of his embafTy was like 
 •o terminate lb happily, was very much damped 
 It feeing himfelf received in this manner. 
 
 * I did not expe(fl to find your lordfliip alone,' 
 
 faid Mr. Munden, — — ' I believe not,* replied he ; 
 
 but an unlucky accident at home deprived me of 
 
 my coufin's company, and your wife it feems did 
 
 not think herfelt fafe with me.' 
 
 Thefe Lll words, and the contemptuous tone 
 in which they were exprefled, put him into the 
 ^xtremefb confternation 5— — ' I hope, my lord,* 
 ried he, ' that Mrs. Munden cannot have To far 
 forgot herfelf as to have afted in any manner 
 unbecoming of the refpe6t due to your lord/hip.' 
 •—— Fine women will have their caprices,' re- 
 amed the peer j — ' but no matter, let no more 
 be faid of it.' 
 
 Mr. Munden then proceeded to repeat what 
 Jr. W— had faid to him, but his lordQiip took 
 :o notice, and feemed entirely unconcerned all 
 he time he was fpeaking 5 till the other adding, 
 lat J f his lordfliip thought proper, he would at- 
 end him in the morning, in order to be at hand, 
 1 caie the event lliould require his prefence : — • 
 
 n which the peer replied peeviihly, - * No,

 * will be no occaliorij — if there be, I can fend 
 » for you.' 
 
 After this, Mr. Mundcn cafily perceiving his. 
 company was rather troublefome than agreeable, 
 made a low obeifance, and withdrew, almolt dif- 
 trafted in his mind at this Hidden turn of temper 
 iu his patron, and no lefs impatient to hear what 
 his wife had to fay on that account. 
 
 It was not in one of the beft of humours, as 
 the reader may eafily imagine, that he now came 
 home, nor did he find Mrs. Munden in one very } 
 proper to alleviate his vexation. She was ex- 
 tremely penfive, and when he asked her in Ibme- 
 what of an imperious voice the.realon of having . 
 left lord **** in fo abrupt a manner, ' Vt'hen you,' 
 iaid file, ' forfook the guardian/hip of my ho- 
 
 * nour, it was time for me to take the defence of. 
 
 * it upon myfelf, which I could do no other way . 
 ' than by flight.' 
 
 ' What is it you mean ?* cried he,—— *.! am 
 ' certain my lord has too much friendfhip for me, 
 
 * toofferany rudenels toyou.'— ' Be not too certain, 
 anfwered /he, ' of the friendfliip of that bafe 
 ' great man.'—— She then began to repeat the dil- 
 courfe, with which his lordfliip had entertained 
 her, after being left alone with him, but had 
 gone through a very fmall part of it, before her 
 husband interrupted her, faying with a kind of a 
 maliciousfneer,— — that he waspofitive there was 
 nothing at all in what flie apprehended 5— that 
 it was impoffible for the noble lord to be in earned 
 wlien he talked to her in fuch terms 5 — that /lie 
 Ind only been deceived by her own vanity, to f 
 nnllakefor a ferious defign upon her virtue, what 
 was only meant for meer gallantry j— — and then 
 added with more paflion, that he feared b.er idle 
 rtfentment had Ibit him all his inlercit with the 
 beil of friends.

 ' How,' faid Mr. Mnnden eagerly,—* he did not 
 ' fure proceed to adions ?' Perceiving he was now 
 in a difpofition to liften with more attention to 
 what me faid than hitherto he had done, (lie 
 hefitated not to acquaint him with every particu- 
 lar of his lordfhip's behaviour to her, and the 
 means by which flie had defended herfelf. 
 
 During his recital, Mr. Munden bit his lips, 
 and appeared in very great emotions j— he fpoke 
 not a word however, till his fair wife, pitying the 
 .anxieties fhe faw him under, defired hmi to think 
 ^no more of this accident fince it was fo happily 
 got over : —— ' It may be fo in your opinion,' 
 anfwered ';;'e fiercely,——' but not in mine:— — • 
 ' I forfee tiie confequences, though you perhaps 
 
 ■ think nu\ of them. -^—'Tis true, my lord's be-

 With thele words he fljng out of the room, and

 thelefs merited fome compafTion : •— he had a 
 great fliare of ambition ; — loved both pleafure 
 and grandeur to an excefs j and though far from 
 being of a generous difpofition, the pride and 
 vanity of his humour made him do many things 
 through oftentation, which his eilate would not 
 well fupport :— he kept company with perfbns 
 of rank and fortune, much fuperior to his own, 
 and as he bore an equal part in their expences 
 whenever he was with them, he flood in need of 
 fbme addition to his revenue : — well therefore 
 might he be chagrined at an accident, that cait fb 
 dark a cloud over that profpedt of interell and ' 
 preferment he had flattered himfelf with from 
 lord ****. 
 
 But though this was the main point, it was not 
 the fole fubjeft of his difcontent. — — The mo- 
 tives for his being fent by lord *♦** to Mr. \Y««-», 
 the pretended quarrel between them, and the 
 trifling excufes made by the latter to r'-'tain him 
 from making too quick a return, were all too ob- 
 vious for him not to be aflured that gentleman was 
 privy, and agreed to be an afliftant in the delign 
 his lordfhip had upon his wife.

 indebted for his feat in parliament 5 but it was not 
 becaufie Mr. Munden knew him to be obliged to 
 do every thing enjoined by his Lord fliip, that re- 
 ftrained the relentment he conceived againft him 
 from breaking out, but becaufe he conftdered that 
 a quarrel between them on this icore might occa-

 Iby any jufl: provocation, is certainly very dreadful 
 jto be borne, and what this injured husband fuf- 
 lllained in the firft emotions of it, muft have excit- 
 ed the pity of every reader of this hiftory, if he 
 had not afterwards meanly vented it where he had 
 inot the leaft occafion for difguft, but rather of the 
 highefl love, tcndernefs, and admiration. 
 
 In the midlt of thele perplexities, however, let 
 us leave him for a while, and return to her whofe 
 beauty had been the innocent caufe of all this trou- 
 ble to him, and danger to herlelf.

 Idangers, — thofe efcapes had ever been capable 
 of making any lafting impreflion on her mind, or 
 fixing her refolution to avoid running again into 
 khe lame miltakes. 
 
 The cruel reproaches and reflexions call on her 
 )by Mr. Munden, filled her not now with the leall

 : ever chance brought him into her company, be- 
 haved towards her with all the dillance and re-

 This lady, now fully convinced how dangerous 
 it was to be too much admired for her external 
 charms, ceafed even to wi<'h they ihouldhe taken 
 notice of, and let herlelf lerioufly about improve- 
 jng thofe perfe(?iions of the mind, which Hie was 
 fenfible could alone entitle her to the efteem of 
 the virtuous and the wife. 
 
 Mr. Munden, who had never been difl]uieted 
 at the former part of his wife's behaviour, was 
 equally infenfible of thiV alteration in her : — his 
 cares, indeed, were too much .taken up for re- 
 eftabliQiing hiralelf with his right hon. patron, to 
 give any attention to what pafs'd at home. 
 
 After much debating withm himfelf, he thought 
 it beft to proceed, io as not to [qk the noble lord 
 ijr.:i:;ine he was acquainted with any part of the 
 attempt made upon his wife j—— but though he 
 attended his levee as ulual,— paid him the. lame

 than ever, he had the mortificati.in to fin! him- 
 felf very cooly received. — He Hood unditlin-

 referve, which made him julliy enou;:^') appre- 
 hend, that he had little now to hope for Fium him." 
 
 The truth is, he faw through the policy of this, 
 dependant 5. — - he could not doubt but Mrs. Mun- 
 den had told him of tlie violence he hxA offered 
 to her 3 — he was confcious of the bafe lels of it, 
 but he was not angry with himlelf for ir, though 
 with the perfon he would have injured, and could' 
 not forgive him for the knowledge of his crime, 
 though the other was willing to forgive the crime 
 itlelf.

<#PG# 300>
The treatment he received ar lord * * * * made 
 him extremely chiirlifh to his wife : — he looked 
 upon her as the primary caufe of his misfortune, 
 curled hi* marriage with her, and even hated her 
 for the beauties and good qualities, which fliould 
 have endeared her to him. — — Nothing ihe could 
 iay, or do, had the power of pleafing him, lb that 
 /lie flood in need of all her courage and fortitude 
 to enable her to fupport, with any tolerable de- 
 gree of patience, the ulage /he received. 
 
 To heighten her misfortune, the late levity of 
 her temper had hindered her from cultivating an 
 acquaintance with any one perlbn, on whofe fe- 
 crecy, fincerity, and fedatenefs /lie could enough. 
 ilepend, for the disburthening her mind of thofft 
 vexations, with which it was fometimes over- 
 whelmed. 
 
 Eur this was a matter of difquiet to her, which 
 /lie had not long to complain of j — heaven fent 
 her a confolation, of which fhe had not the leaft 
 diftant expeSation, and reftored her to a friend, 
 by whom fhe had thought herfelf utterly forfaken,

 fame curiofity, and it was at this woman's houle, 
 that thefe ladies happened to meet after fo long 
 an ablence from each other. 
 
 Mrs. Munden was a little confufed at firft fight 
 of her, as bringing to her mind fome paflages, 
 v/hich it was never in her power to think on with 
 the indifference ihe wiflied to do. -~^ They em-

 ' bracecl, however, with a great deal of affeiilon> 
 •^— made each other the ufiial coniplimems on 
 the nuituai change of their condition, for lady 
 Loveir, by fome accident, had heard of Mrs. 
 Munden's marriage. 
 
 Though both thefe ladies were much more 
 talcen up with each other than with examining the 
 trifles they came to fee, yet neither of them 
 would quit the fliop without becoming culbomeis : 
 — - lady Loveit perceiving that Mrs. Munde.n had 
 neither coach, nor chair at the door, after having 
 aflced what part of the town /lie lived in, and 
 finding it was not too much out of her way, de- 
 fired Ihe would give her leave to fet her down in 
 her chariot. 
 
 Mrs, Munden readily accepted the offer, and 
 being come to the door of her houfe, would have 
 perfuaded lady Loveit to alight, ?Ln^ come in, 
 but (he excufed herfelf, and at the fame time 
 gave her a prefling invitation to her houle as foon 
 as opportunity permitted. — ' I know, madam,* 
 faid fhe Imiling,' ' that it is my duty to pay the 
 *• firft vifit to your ladyfhip, — yet as you are 
 
 * here, — I (hould not ftand on that punftilio 
 
 * with you,' interrupted lady Loveit, with the 
 fame good humour, ' but I expefl company at 
 ' home, and know not but that they already wait 
 
 * for me.' The other then told her, llie would 
 do herfelf tho fivour to attend her lady hip in a 
 day or two : and this was all that pafled'atthis 
 firit entervievv. 
 
 Mrs. Munden was extremely rejoiced at the op- 
 portunity of renewing her acquaintance with this 
 lady, in whom fhe had not the leifl room to 
 doubt, but that n\e fhould find what Hie fo much 
 wanted, a faithful adviler and an agreeable com- 
 panion j — they had always loved each other j 
 — there was a great parity of fentimenc aiid prin- 
 C c 3 ciple 
 

<#PG# 302>
igA. ne HISTORY of 
 
 ciple between them, and as nothing but their 
 different ways of thinking in point of condu6l 
 towards the men, had hindered them from being 
 infeparable friends, that bar being removed by 
 Mrs. M linden's change of temper, and her being 
 now, what lady Loveit always was, no other re- 
 mained to keep the^n from communicating their 
 thoughts with the utmoft freedom to each other. 
 
 The vifit promifed by Mrs. Munden, was not 
 delayed beyond the time /lie mentioned ; lady 
 Loveit received her without the lead referve, 
 and they foon entered info converfation with the 
 fame fprightlinels, as before the change of their 
 conditions. 
 
 Mrs. Munden had refolved within herfelf, not 
 to make the leaft mention of Mr. Trueworth's 
 name, but feeling, notwithftanding, a good deal 
 of impatience to hear fomething of him, artfully 
 entered into a difcourfe, which fhe knew muft 
 draw the other in to fay fomething concerning 
 him. 
 
 ' I need not aft,' faid (he, * how you liked the 
 
 * country ; it is pretty plain from your continuing 
 ' there fuch a length of time, that you found more 
 *, pleafures at fir Bazil's fear, than any you had 
 
 * left behind.' ' The houfe is well fituated in-

 ' the leaft part of my time there, fince I left Lonr 
 ' don, — nor have we ftaid away io long entirely 
 ' through choice, but have in a manner been de- 
 
 * tained by a fucceffion of accidents altogether un- 
 ' forefeen. 
 
 ' It took up fix weeks,' continued flie, * to re- 
 
 * ceive the vifits, which were every day crouded 
 
 * upon us, from all parts of the country ; - ■■ this 
 
 * hurry being over, we could do no lefs than ac-

 we flayed about a fortnight ; — after which, (ir 
 
 ] Bazil having promii'ed my brother and filler 
 Trueworth, to pafs fome tia^e with them in 
 Oxford-fhire, we crofled the country to that 
 
 ; gentleman's fine feat, where, as you may fup- 
 pofe, his arrival was welcomed in much the 
 
 : iame manner fir Bazil'shad been in Stafford/hire : 
 — befides all his relations, intimate friends, te- 
 nants and dependants, I believe there was fcarce 
 a gentleman or lady, twenty miles round, who, 
 
 1 did not come to congratulate him on his marriage 
 
 ; and return. 
 
 * For the reception of thofe guells,' wentfhe 
 till on, * the generous Mr. Trueworth omitted 
 
 nothing that might teitify his joy on the occafion 
 of their coming 5 — feafting employed their 
 days, and balls their nights : — but alas ! in the 
 midft of theft variegated fcenes of pleafure, 
 death — fudden death, fnatched away the 
 fource of all our joys, and turned the face of 
 jgladnefs into the moll poignant grief. 
 
 * Death, did your ladyfhip fay !' cried Mrs. 
 Vlunden, with an extraordinary emotion, ' Is 
 
 then Mr, Trueworth dead ?' ' No madam,' re- 
 plied the other, wiping away fome tears, which 
 ihe memory of this fatal accident drew from her 
 i^yes, ' Mr. Trueworth lives, and I hope will long 
 I do i'o^ to be an honour to his country, and a 
 ( comfort to all, who are fo happy as to know 
 I him, — for certainly there never was a man more 
 f endued with qualities for univerfal good j — •

 ing /he dilcovered fome Tymptoms of a fever, 
 but it proved no more than the forerunner of the 
 fmall-pox, of which diftemper flie died, before 
 her danger was apprehended, even by the phy- 
 lician.' 
 * How I pity both the living and the dead,' faid 
 
 Mrs. Munden, ' Mr. True worth certainly could not 
 fupport {o great a lols, with any degree of mode- 
 ration ?'—' The fliock at firft,' replied lady, 
 
 Loveit, ' was as much as all his philofophy and 
 ftrength of realon could enable him to com- 
 bat with : — fir Bazil, though deeply afFecled 
 for the lofs of fo amiable a filter, was obliged to 
 conceal his own Ibrrows, the better to alleviate 
 thofe he faw him in, and this kept us for two 
 whole months at his houle after the ceremony of 
 the funeral was over. We had then prevailed on 
 him to return with us to London ^ everything 
 was prepared for our departure, when an unlucky, 
 accident happened to mylelf, which detained 
 us for yet a confiderable time longer. 
 ' We were diverting ourfelves one day with ang- 
 ling,' continued fhe, * when in endeavouring to 
 caft my rod at too great a diftance, I ftooped fo 
 far over the bank, that I plunged all at once,

 mediately carried into the houfe, ftript of my wet 
 garments, and put into a warm bed, but the 
 fright had fo great an effect upon me, that it 
 caufed an abortion, which as I was then in the 
 fifth month of my pregnancy, had like to have 
 
 proved fatal to me : I was clofe prifoner to 
 
 my chamber for feveral weeks, and on my being 
 juft able to leave it, was advifed to have recourfe, 
 fiift ro the Briftol, and then to the Bath waters^ 
 for the better eftablifhment of my health : ap- 
 cordingly we went to both thof« places, llayed 
 as long at each as I found needful for the purpofe 
 that brought me thither, and on my perfedi re- 
 covery, fir Bazil having fome bufinels at his e* 
 ftate, returned to Staffordfhire j — — made a fhort 
 excurfion to Mrs. Wellair's, and then we bowled

 MRS. Munden carried enough home with her 
 from lady Loveit's, to employ her mind for 
 
 that whole night at lead j what flie had been 
 
 told in relation to the death of Mrs. Trueworrh, 
 railed a llrange contrariety of ideas in her, which 
 it was impollible for he'r either to reconcile or o- 
 blige either the one or the other totally lofubide.- 
 She thought it great pity, that fo virtuous, ib' 
 beautiful, and fo acco^iplifh'd a young lady, as 
 /■he had been told Mrs. Trueworrh was, (hould- 
 thus early be fnatch'd away from all the juys of 
 love and life, but could not lament lomelancholy 
 an incident, in a manner (he was fenfible it de- 
 ferred : - envy had ever been a Ihanger to her 
 
 breafi, yet fince her own marriage, and that of Mr. 
 TrueA'orth vvith his lady, ff.e had fomerimes been 
 tempted to accufe heaven of partiali-y, in making 
 
 io wide a difference in their fates : and though 
 
 the blame of her misfortunes lay wholly on her- 
 felf, had been apt to imagine, that /he had only 
 been impelled by an unavoidable impulii?, to zd: 
 as fhe had done, and was fated by an invincible 
 neceffity, to be the enemy of her own happinefs. 
 ^.Tlnis did this fair piedeflinarian reafon v^-ithin 
 herlelf, whenever the ill ufage of Mr. Munden 
 
 made 
 

<#PG# 307>

 made her refleift on the geneiofity of Mr. True- 
 worth:— —fhe repined not at the felicities, (he 
 liippofed were enjojed by Mrs. Triieworrh, but 
 regretted that her own lot had been cart ib vaftly 
 different. 
 
 But though a]] thefe little heart-burnings now 
 ceafed, by the de^th of that I'o lately happy ladv, 
 and even common huuianity demanded the tri> 
 bute of companion for her deltiny, of "Ahich none 
 had a greater /hare, on other o^callons, than Mrs. 
 Munden, yet could fhe not on this pay it without 
 lome interruptions from a Cf^ntrary emotion ;—— 
 in theie moments, if- it may be faid fli.e grieved at 
 all, it was UKsre becaui'e Hie knew, that Mr. True- 
 worth was grieved, than tor the caule that made 
 him lo. 
 
 Her good fenle, her juftice, and her good na- 
 ture, however, gave an immediate check to fuch 
 feii'iments, whenever fhe found them rifing in her, 
 but her utmoft efforts could no: wholly iubdue 
 them:— -there was a fecret I'omerhing in her 
 heart, which die would never allow herfelf to 
 think Hie was poffelt of, that in fpite of all Ihe 
 couid do, diffliled an involuntary fatisfadlion at 
 the knowledge, that Mr. Truevvorth was a uid- 
 dower. 
 
 If lady Loveit could have forefeen the com- 
 motions her dilcourle raifed in the breaft of her 
 fair friend, Hie would certainly never have enter- 
 tained her with it, but ilie lo little fiifpeded her 
 having any tendernefs for Mr. Trueworth, that 
 /lie (jbferved not the changes in her countenance, 
 when ihe nientioned that gentleman, as (he af- 
 terwards frequently did, on m.my occafions, in 
 the courfe of the vilits to each other j — nor 
 could Mis. Munden, being ignorant herfelf of the 
 real caufe of the agitations ihe was in, make her 
 ladyfhip a confidant in this, as /lie did in all her 
 
 other 
 

<#PG# 308>
po -The Hl^'tOU^ :»/ 
 
 other afFairs, — the little happinefs Ihe enjoyed 
 in marriage not excepted. 
 
 Lady liOveit had indeed a pretty right idea of 
 her misfortune in this point, before (he heard it 
 from herfelf : — fir Bazil, tho' not at all conver- 
 fant with Mr. Munden, was well acquainted with 
 his character, and manner of behaviour, and the 
 account he gave of both to her on being told to 
 whom he was married, left her no room to doubt 
 how difagreeable a fituation the wife of fuch a 
 husband muft be in : — fhe heartily commife- 
 rated her hard fate;— yet, as lady Trufty had 
 done, faid every thing to perfuade her to bear 
 it with a becoming patience. 
 
 Perceiving fhe had loll fome part of her viva- 
 city, and would frequently fall into very melan- 
 cholly mufings, fir Bazil himfelf, now fully con- 
 vinced of her merit, and good qualities, added 
 his endeavours to thofe of his amiable coniort 
 for the exhilerating her fpirits : — they would 
 needs have her make one in every party of plea- 
 liire, either formed by themfelves, or wherein 
 they had a fhare, and obliged her to come as of- 
 ten to their houfe as fhe could do without giving 
 offence to her domeftic tyrant. 
 
 An excefs of gaiety when curbed, is apt to de- 
 generate into its contrary extream : — it muft 
 therefore be confefs'd that few things could have 
 been more lucky for Mrs. Munden than this event, 
 
 ' flie had lofl: all relifli for the converfation of 
 
 the Mifs Airilhes, and thole other giddy creatures, 
 which had compofed the greatefl part of her ac- 
 quaintance, and too much folitude might have 
 brought on a gloominefs of temper, equally un- 
 eafy to herfelf, and to thofe about her, but the 
 fociety of thofe worthy friends, — the diver- 
 fions they prepared for her, and the company 
 to which they introdaced her, kept up her na- 
 tive

 live livelineis of mind, and at the fame time con- 
 vinced her, that pleafure was no enemy to virtue, 
 or to reputation, when partook with perfons of 
 honour and difcretion. 
 
 She had been with them one evening, when 
 the fatisfa^tion fhe took in their converfation, the 
 prefliues they made to detain her, joined to the 
 •knowledge, that there was no danger of Mr. 
 Munden's being uneafy at her abfence, he feldoai 
 coming home till towards day-break, engaged 
 her to ilay till the night was pretty far advanced, 
 yet late as it was, (he was prefented with an ad- 
 venture of as odd a kind, as ever fiie had been 
 furprized with. 
 
 She was undreffing, in order to go to bed, wherj 
 fhe heard a very loud knocking at the llreer-door, 
 after which her footman came up, and told her, 
 that a woman was below, who faid ihe mu(t fpeak 
 with her immediately. ——' I /hall fpeak to no 
 
 * body at this time of the night,' faid Mrs. Mun- 
 den, ' therefore go down and tell her fo.' — The 
 fellow went, but returned in a moment or two, 
 and told her, that the perfbn would take no de- 
 
 l^tiial, nor would go out of the houfe without fee- 
 ing her. — ' Some very impudent creature, fure,* 
 faid Mrs. Munden, — ' but do you go,' added fhe 
 in the fame breath, to the maid that waited on 
 her, ' and afl; hername and bufinefs, — if /he will 
 
 * tell neither, let her be turned out of the houfe.' 
 
 She was in a good deal of perplexity, to think 
 who (hould enquire for her at that late hour, when 
 the fervant flae had fent to examine into the mat- 
 ter, came back, and before /he had well entered 
 the chamber, cried out, ——'Lord, madam, I 
 ' never was fb afloniflied in my life ! I wonder 
 
 * Tom could fpeak in fuch a rude manner 5 — — 
 
 * the woman, as he called her, is a very fine lady,

 ' Wei), but her name and bufinefs,' demanded 
 Mrs. Munden, haftily. * Nay, m.adam,' replied 
 the maid, ' flie will tell neither, but to yourfelfj 
 ' fo pray, dear madam, either come down flairs, 
 
 * or let her be brought up, — I am fure fhe does 
 
 * not look as if fhe would do you any hurt.' 
 
 Mrs. Munden paused a little on what fhe had . 
 heard, and believing there muft be fometliing very 
 extraordinary, indeed, both in the perfon, and 
 the vifir, relolved to be convinced of the truth, 
 therefore, having given a ftri6l charge, tljat both 
 the footmen fliould be ready at her call, in cafe 
 there iliould be any occafion for them, went mio 
 the dining room, and ordered that the perlon who 
 enquired for her, fhould be introduced. 
 
 Her whole appearance anfwered exaiflly to the 
 delcription that had been given of her by the 
 maid, but it was her face vvhidi moft alarmed Mrs. 
 Munden, as being pofitive fhe had leen it before,*"^ 
 though when, or where, flie could not at that in- 
 ftant recc)lle6i. 
 
 But the ftranger foon eafed her rf the fufpenfe 
 flie was in, when throwing herlelf at her feet, 
 and buifting into a flood of rears, ' you onceofFer- 
 
 * ed me your friendfhip, madam,' iaid flie,——' a 
 
 * confcioufneis of my own unworthinels, made

 * plore your companion, and charitable proredriun. 
 
 * , I have no hope of fafety, cr of flielter, 
 ' bur in your goodnels and generofity.' 
 
 The accents of her voice nuw difcovered her 
 to be no either, than the lady Mrs. Munden had 
 leen at the mercer's:--^ fhe was ftrangely c.'>n- 
 
 fojiinded,

 founded, but not fo much as to hinder her from 
 raifing the diflrefled fair one, with the greateft 
 civility, and leating her in a chair, — ' Though 
 ' I cannot comprehend, madam,' anfwered fhe, 
 
 * by what accident you are reduced to addrefs me 
 
 * in thele teems, yet you may rely upon my readi- 
 
 * nefs to affift the unfortunate, efpecially, a per- 
 
 * fon, whom I cannot but look upon, as tar from

 * Oh,, would to God,' cryed the other, very 
 emphatically, ' that my hiliory could preferve 
 ' that kind opinion in you 5 but alas, though I find 
 
 * myfeU obliged to relate it to you, in order to 
 '■ obtain the protection I intreat, I tremble, left 
 ^ by doing ib, I fhould forfeit thofe pretentions to 
 ' your mercy, which orherwife my fex, and my 
 ^dilhefs, might jaftly claim.' 
 
 Thefe words were fufficient to have excited the 
 curiofity of a woman, who had lc(s of that pro- 
 penfity in her nature, than Mrs.'Munden; fhe 
 
 told her, that by being made the confidant of her 
 affairs, Jhe fhould think herfelf obliged to excufe 
 whatever flie found not worthy of her approbation. 
 
 ' Prepare yourlelf then,- madam,' iiud her ftill 
 weeping gueft, — »' fumnion all your goodnefs to

 This expredion funk more deeply in ihe mind 
 of Mrs. Munden, than the peribn uttered it, ima- 
 gined :— — (he made no reply, however, and the

 ment -J we embarked together, and came to 
 
 England, where I have had the command of his 
 family, and lived with him in all things like a 
 
 wife, except the name. But fortune, always 
 
 rny enemy, conjured up a fpirit ,of jealoufy in 
 him, for my torment at firlt, and at lall for my 
 utter ruin. — His fears of lofing me, as he pre- 
 tended, fecluded me from all Ibciety,— denied 
 me all the publick diverfions of the town, and 
 though 1 lived amidft the very feat of pleafures, 
 kept me as much a (Iranger to them, as if I had 
 been a thoufand leagues removed j — but oh !

 ^ I ^HE husband of Mrs. Munden being engaged

 to get into bed before he came hoine, which fhe

 any tbing ro him of her new guelt, till Hie had 
 talked farther with her, and alio examined into 
 the truth of the affair, which brought her thither. 
 
 The more (he reflected on the account that ia- 
 dy had given of herlelf, the lelsreafon (he found 
 to give credit to fome pafiages in it 5 — ihe could 
 not think that a prince, fuch as theduke de M— — , 
 would on a meer fuggeftion call a woman out to 
 niilery and beggary, whom he had iJ) paffionateiy 
 loved J — and yet leis could (he believe, that her 
 brother, a niaa not fiery by nature, could have 
 afted in the manner fhe had reprefented, without 
 a much greater provocation than what ihe pre- 
 tended. 
 
 Beiides, the mercer bringing home goods fb 
 Inte at night to a cullomer, and being locked up 
 with her, feemed ib inconfiilent with innocence, 
 that (he could not help being of opinion, that the 
 caufe muft be bad indeed, which had no better 
 plea for its defence. 
 
 It alfo afforded her a good deal of matter for 
 vexation, that by expreffing in luch warm terms, 
 the great liking Ihe took of this lady, when they 
 accidentally met at the mercer's, fhe had encou- 
 raged her to make choice of her houie for an afy- 
 lum in her diftrefs, and by this means, rendered 
 herlelf interefted in the concerns of a ftranger, 
 who, at the bell, it did not well become her to 
 take part with. 
 
 But her moft alarming apprehenfions were in 
 relation to her brother :— ]he knew not but if 
 irritated to the high degree mademf)ife!le de Ro- 
 quelair had defcribed, he might in reality have 
 been guilty of fome rafli a(51:ion, which might en- 
 danger his reputation, and even his life.

 fhe difpatched a lervant to her brother's houfe 
 under p'-efence of enquiring after his heahh, not 
 doubting, but by the anfwer he would bring, /he 
 fhould be able to form fcmie conjeftute, whether 
 any thing of ti"je nature mademoilelle de Roque- 
 lair feemed to apprehend, had really happened 
 or not. 
 
 The man returning with intelligence, that Mr. 
 Thoughtlefs was very well, and not yet ftirring, 
 gave her great confolition 5—— fhe then went up 
 to the chamber of mademoifelle, and after giving 
 her the ulual lalutatiuii of the morning, far down 
 by her bedixde, and began to talk to her in this 
 manner. 
 
 * Madam, faid /lie, I have been confi<lering on 
 
 * your ftory, and as I /incerely pi'y the nnsfortones 
 ' to which you have reduced yourfelf, flinuld be 
 
 * glad to know, by what method you propofe to

 ' pait remedy j— I neither hope, nor /hill en- 
 ' deavour a reconciliation witH Mr. Thoughtlefs; 
 t «— 1 have long fince been both afhamed, and 
 ' weary of the errors of my conduff, though i

 * wifli than to pais my future life in that only re- 
 ' treat for wretches like mylelf — a monaftery. 
 
 Her ftrcaming eyes, — her moving accents, and 
 above all, the leemiag contrition fhe expreflcd 
 for her faults, raifed fuch a flow of tendernels in 
 the foul of Mrs. Munden, that ibe reiolved from 
 that inliant, to do every thing in her power to 
 lerve her. 
 
 * As the teligion of your country,' faid flie, 
 
 * and in which you were bred, aff irds a great 
 'number of thole fafe and fuie afylums forperI(jns 
 
 * who have made an ill ule of their liberty, you 
 
 * cannot, indeed, do better than to fl) to fome one 
 ' of tliem for refuge friim temptations, which you 
 
 * have too much experienced the force of ^ and if 
 ' you perievere in this good difpofition, I will en- 
 
 * deavour to ptocure the means of rendering you 
 ' able to accomplifh fo laudable a delire. 
 
 ' Ah, madam I' cried mademoifelle de Roquc-

 ' accidents of my life have convinced me, there 
 
 * can be no real happinefs without virtue, and 
 
 * that the moil certain defence of virtue is religi-

 * means of being received within thole facied 
 
 * walls, from which the fatal love of Mr. Thought- 
 Mefsdrewme, 1 flioidd think my guardian an- 
 
 * gel had nor tiaite forlook me.' 
 
 On this, the good natured believing Mrs. Mun- 
 den faid many kind things to her,— made her 
 take lome refre.'l.ment, as fhe lay in bed, in which 
 fhe advifed her to continue li)me time, and endea- 
 vour to comp >fe herlelf tp fieep, Ihe leeniing to 
 Itand in need of it very rruich :— ~in going out 
 of the chamber, /l:ie told her fhe would return in 
 a few hours, but if flte wanted any thir-g in the 
 mean time, on her ringing a bell by her bed-lide, 
 a iTiaid feivant would immediately attaid upon

 * his duty to lend her to one, for it cannot be ex- 
 
 * ped^ed her father will make a fecond offer of that 
 
 * ibrt.' 
 
 With thefe refleflions, together with others on 
 the manner in which it would be moft proper to 
 addrefs Mr. Thoughtlefs on this I'core, was her 
 mind taken up, till the hour fhe iniagined he 
 might be llirring j — the dilluihances, which muft 
 neceflarily have happened in his family the night 
 before, m.ade her iuppofe he might lie longer 
 than uliul, but flie chofe rather to wait a while 
 for his riling, than hazard lofing the opportunity 
 of fpeakijig to him, by his being gone abroad. 
 
 That gentleman had, in fa61, pafTed the moft 
 difagreeable night he had ever known : — he had 
 loved Mademoiielle de Roquelair with fuch an 
 extravagance of fondnels, that he had fometimes 
 been even prompted by it to marry her, but the 
 too great warmth of her conftitution, and the 
 known inconftancy of her temper, has often de- 
 terred him from ir, and alfo made him reftrain her 
 from many of thofe liberties he would otherwife 
 have allowed her; — he had thought himlelf no 
 leis fecure of her perfon, than fhe always pre- 
 tended he was of her heart ,— and now to find 
 all his tendernefs for her abufed, all his precau- 
 tions fruftrated, might well raife in him paflions 
 of the moft defperate kind. 
 
 The inclinations of this woman were, in reality,- 
 too vicious to be bound by any obligations, or 
 withheld from their gratifications j by any of the 
 
 methods

 methods taken for that purpofe : • — /lie loved va- 
 riety, — fhe longed for change, without confult- 
 ing whether theobjetl: was fuitable or not, — the 
 mercer had a perlon and addrefs agieenbie enou^^h 5 
 he was of an amorous complexion, and readily 
 improved the advances (he made him 5 he fie- 
 <luently came to her under the pretence of bring- 
 ing patterns of filks, or other things in his way of 
 trade 5— —and all this, as /he imagined, without 
 raifing any ful'picion in the family •— — no inter- 
 ruptinn happening in their repeated interviews, 
 fhe Ibmetimes kept him with her till near th« 
 hour, in which Mr. ThoughtJefs ufually came 
 home, which was feldom till one or two o'clock. 
 But on this unlucky night it fofell ou^, ihac 
 a very ill run of play, and the lofs of all the 
 money he had about him, brought him ho.me 
 
 much fooner than was his cullom j a fervant 
 
 teing at the door, prevented his knocking, lb 
 that the lovers had not the leaft notice how neajr 
 he was to them j — he went dire(5^iy into hisdrei'-, 
 iing-room, which was backwards on the ground 
 .floor, and fat mufing for (ome time — cafting up 
 the fums he had loll, — curfing fortune within 
 himfelf, and protefting never to touch a card, or 
 throw a dice again, when on a fudden he was 3- 
 Jarmed with the found (jf a man's voice laughinp 
 very heartily, — he flampt with his foot, and a 
 fervant immediately coming up, — — 'Is theie 
 
 * any company above?' demanded he haflilv : —— 
 
 * None, fir, but tlie mercer, that conic-s to madam 
 
 * 't.vith filks,' replied 'he man ' A mercer at 
 
 * this tiine of night,' cried Mr. Thougmlefs, — — 
 ^ how long has he been here T — ' I cannot tell,

 * Telle de Roquelair come down tome.' 
 
 If this unfaithful woman had been butmiftre/s 
 of artifice enough to have made any one of the 
 family her friend, fhe would certainly have been 
 told, that Mr. Thoughtlefs was come home, and 
 her gallant might eafily have flipt out of the houfe, 
 without his knowledge, — but on the contrary, 
 her imperious behaviour towards them, fet them 
 all in general againft her ; — this fellow in parti- 
 cular, whom fhe had ufed worfe than the rell", re- 
 joiced that his maffer was likely to find out what 
 he wiflied him to know, but never durff acquaint 
 him with. 
 
 On his going up flairs, he found they were flnit 
 in the bed-chamber, and running to his mafler 
 with this account, •—' Look«d in the chamber,* 
 faid Mr. Thoughtlefs, fUrting up!—' Yes, fir/ 
 anfwercd the fervant, ' and nobody would anlWer, 
 
 * though I knocked two or three times 5'— which 
 by the way, if he did at all, it was too fbftly for 
 them to hear. 
 
 * Confufion !' cried Mr. Thoughtlefs, now work- 
 ed up to the highefl pitch of jealous rage, ' i'il 
 
 * try if they will open to me.'«— With thel'e words, 
 he drew his Iword, and flew up flairs, burft open 
 the door, and ruflied into the room with all the 
 fury of an incenfed lien : — the aftoniflied guilty 
 pair had neither thought nor means to efcape ;— 
 the lover, on the firll burft of the door, jumped 
 out of the window into the yard 5— mademoi- 
 lelle run fcieaming to one corner of the room j — 
 
 * Abaiic'oned woman,* cried Mr. Thoughilefs, 
 
 * your puniihment fhallbe the fecond courfe 3' — 
 then .followed by his man with lights, ran in pur- 
 liiit of the perlon who had injured him. 
 
 This unhappy woman not daring to fland the 
 temptft of his rage, when he fhould return, took

 the opportiiniry of his having quitted the cham- 
 ber, to make her efcape,— though at the time 
 /lie did la, as flie had truly told Mrs. Munden, 
 ihe neither knew where, nor to whom flie Ihould 
 apply for refuge. 
 
 The mercer, in the mean time, was found by 
 Mr. Thoughtlefs, but in a condition more excite- 
 ing pity than reven?,2 j the poor man hid broke 
 both his legs with his fall, and wasotherwife very 
 much hurt 5 but on feeing by whom, and in what 
 manner he was approached, the terror of inA-iie- 
 diate death made him exert all the llrength that 
 Wis left in him, to cry out for pardon 5 which 
 word he repeated over and over in the moil la- 
 mentable tfjr.e that could be : — Mr. Thoughtlefs, 
 on this, turned hadily away, bidding his lervants 
 raii'e and carry hiin into the hall, where a chair 
 being prefendy brought, he was put into it, and 
 fent home to make the belt excufe he could to his 
 wife for the miichief that had happened to him. . 
 
 Every room was afterwards fearched for made- 
 moi(elle de Roquelair, but Hie not being found, 
 and a maid fervant remerabring, tha^ in the midft 
 of the confufion, the itreet-door had been left 
 open, the flight of that lady was not to be doubted. 
 
 Though thefe difturbances had taken up the 
 greateft part of the night, Mr. Thoughtlefs was 
 able to enjoy little repole after going to bed, and 
 rofe rather looner than ufual j — he was up and 
 drefled, when his fifter came, but w.is a good 
 deal furprized to be told of her being rhere, as 
 /he had never villted him before without a formal 
 invitation. 
 
 ' Good morrow, my dear fiftcr,' fa id he, as 
 foonas ilie was introduced, ' this is a favour quite

 interrupting her, ' what knowledge have you of

 onfly related to him, how they had met by acci-

 ' is,' laid he, ^ to make friendlhip at firfl fight ; 
 M Hit line ihe wretch cannot flatter her/elf with

 ' Far be it from me, fir,' replied Mrs. Munden, 
 very gravely, ' to become the negotiator of fuch

 Comains a mo(t pocking inflance of infidelity and

 MAdemoifelle de Roquelair, on finding how 
 far the good nature of Mrs. Munden had 
 made her intereft herfeif in her behalf, exprefled 
 the tranfports of her gratitude in terms, which 
 gave fome pain to the modefty of that lady to

 Mrs. Munden paufed a little at this requed, but 
 thinking it would be cruel in this diftrels to have 
 recourle to Grangers, and to whom Ihe could com- 
 municate nothing of her mind, made this reply, 
 — — ' Though it would be highly inconvenient,

 Madem.oifelle de Roquelair was beginning to 
 give Ibme frefh teilimonies of the fenle fhe had 
 of this laft obligation, but Mrs. Munden would 
 not fuffcr her to proceed, and pointing to a lland- 
 iih that flood upon the table, defired her to write 
 the memorandum fhe had mentioned 5— ' Obe- 
 ' dience, madam, is better than facrifice,' faid the 
 other, and immediately did as fhe was direded 5 
 — after which Mrs. Munden went down to give 
 the orders fhe had promifed. 
 
 She fent this inventory by her own man, and in- 
 fl; iiiied him to procure perfcjns for bringing thi- 
 ther every thing belonging to mademoifelle de 
 Roquelair j but as this could not be done, and 
 that lady drefs'd, before the hour ot dining, which 
 was juil at hand, {\\t judged it improper flie 
 jhouid appear at table, till fhe could do lb with 
 greater decency j- fhe therefore bid one of the 
 maids prepare f<,mething apart, and lerve it up to 
 h?r in her own chamber. 
 
 She then began to confider what fhe fnould fay

 knew not but he might already be apprized of 
 what had pafled, or if even he were not lb, fhe 
 thought it would be impoflible to keep her in the 
 houfe without his privity,^— fo relolved to be 
 quite open in the affiir. 
 
 She was right in her conjeflure, — mademoirelle 
 de Roquelair had happened to ring the bell lor 
 ibmething ihe wanted ^— Mr. Munden hearing 
 it, and knowing his wife was abroad, aflced who 
 was above, and this q-uellion occalioned the man, 
 who was then dreffing him, to give hini an account, 
 as far a-; was in his power to do, of ihe iall nipht's 
 accident. 
 
 This a little furprized him, yet not enough to 
 keep him from the park, where lie conftantly 
 walked every day an hour or two before dinner j 
 but on his return, he immediately interrogated 
 his wife, concerning her new guefl: : on which llie 
 told him, without the lead relerve, every circum- 
 ftance of rhis tranfadion : he lillened attentive- 
 ly to what ihe faid, but teftified neiiher any dif- 
 like, <.r approbati(;n of her conduit in this re/peO r

 Ipeaking, bur behaved with the fame liillen filence 
 he had always done fince her adventure with lord 
 * * * *, and as loon as dinner was over, went out 
 to pafs the remainder of the day, and belt part of 
 the night, according to cullom. 
 
 Mrs, Munden's good nature would not fuffer 
 her to go abroad the whole afternoon, r— Ihe pal- 
 fed all the hours till bed-time, with mademoilejle 
 de Roquelair, and did every thing in lier power, 
 both to comfort her in the aifii(5lion Vaz was under, 
 and to fortify her in the good relolution fhe Teem-

320 The HISTORY 9f 
 
 To Mrs. MuNDEN. 
 
 * Dear fifler, 
 
 IN compliance with your defires, and to be cer- 
 tain of getting eternally rid of the fi-ht of a 
 woman who has To much abufed the kindnefi I 
 had for her, I confent to grant her requeft of be- 
 ing enabled to go into a monaftery ; a friend of 
 mine has great dealings with a merchant at Bo- 
 lognej— — I will lee him this afternoon, and pay 
 into his hands the fum which I am told is fuffici- 
 ent for that purpofe : — if you give yourlelf the 
 trouble to call on me ro-morrow morning, I 
 will give you his order for her receiving it on 
 her arrival. — I cannot think of entering your 
 houfe, while flie is in it, but am always, 
 ' Dear fifter, 
 
 ' Your afFe(5lionate brother, 
 
 ' T. l^HOUGIITLESS.* 
 
 Mrs. Munden having imparted the contents of 
 this epiftle to mademoiielie de Roquelair, flie 
 Teemed as much content, as a perlon in !ier cir- 
 cumftances could be ; fl"'ie dined below that day, 
 and .Mr. Munden treated her with the 1 une polite- 
 nefs and complaiiance he always ulcd towards 
 perlbns, over whom he had no power. 
 
 The next morning did not fail ot carrying his 
 fair wife to her brother's, about the hour, in which 
 /he imagined he would expeft her, but on the 
 moment of her entance, flie had the mortification 
 of being accofted by him in thefe terms, ' My 
 ' dear fifter,' faid he,' * I was jult going to fend to 
 
 * you, to prevent your giving youtlelf this need- 
 ' lels trouble. -— The gentleman I went to is out 
 
 * ot town, and will not return thefe two dajs ; fo 
 ' nothing can be d(^ne in this woman's affair till he 
 
 * conies back.'—— She told liim (he was extremely 
 forry, 'becaufe,' laid 11 le, 'delays are Ibmetimes 
 
 dangerous :

 ' (Tangerous : but I hope my dear brother, no fe- 
 
 * cond confiderations will make you frultrate the 
 ' good intentions of this unhappy penitent.— No, 
 
 * no,' cried he, ' I vvilh fhe may perfevere \n 
 ' them, as ftedfaftlv as I fliall to the promife I 
 ' have niade.' Satisfied with this afflirance, fhe 
 took her leave, little liilpetfiing, while fjie 
 was labouring with ail her might in this good of- 
 fice, that cruel and ungenerous return, whicli was 
 about to be made tor her compairion. 
 
 Mr. Munden had feen mademoifelle de Ro- 
 quelair no more than once, but that once was 
 iufficient to make him become enamoured 5 — her 
 beauty fired him, — the known wantcjnnels of her 
 inclinations encouraged him, — he icarce doubtecf 
 of (iiccels, but in cal'e of failure, and if Ihe fhould 
 even acquaint his wife with his attempt, her cha- 
 racter furniflied him with the pretence of having 
 made it only to try how far lier converfion was 
 fincere. 
 
 He therefore hefitated not a moment if he 
 /hould endeavour the accomplifhments of his de- 
 fires, and for the doing fo, no time was to be loff, 
 as fhe was fo fuddenly to depart. Mrs. Munden 
 was no looner gone out, than he went foftly up 
 flairs to the chamber of this too lovely and lels 
 more virtuous flranger 5 flie was fitting m a pen- 
 five pofture, leaning her head upon her hand, 
 when he came in, bur rofe to receive him with 
 that refpec^l, which /he thought diV.c from her to 
 the husband of her proreflrefs. 
 
 After the falutations of the morning were over, 
 
 * Is it pofiible,' cried he, taking one oi: her hands, 
 and looking earneftly on her face, ' that fuch 
 ' youth, fuch beauty, charms in luch profufion, 
 ' Ihould be condemned to a cloyfler ! —— no, it 
 ' can never be, — all the powers of love and ]dea- 
 
 * fure, forbid you to make lb unnatural a choice." 
 
 — Tranfported 
 

<#PG# 330>
322 The HISTORY of 
 
 -- Tranlporred and amazed at hearing him fpeak 
 in this manner, fhe could not forbear telling him 
 with her eyes, that her thoughts correlponded 
 with his words, but willing her tongue /hould 
 ]3referve the decency of the charafter Hie had af- 
 lumed, at leail till he /liould make a farther de- 
 claration of his fentiments 5 — ' If I were indeed,' 
 anlweied flie, * all that can be defcribed of beau- 
 
 * tiful, I could not fure be an offering too amiable 
 
 * for heaven.' 
 
 ' Heaven never gave you thefe perfections,' re- 
 fumed he, * to be concealed in a dark, lonefome 
 ' cellj — thofe melting lips of yours v/ere never 
 
 * formed to kifs the feet of a cold lifelefs image, 
 
 * or pour forth orajI^)ns to unhearin[> lainrs, but to 
 
 * make bled ff)me. warm — fome happy he, who 
 
 * knows, and has the power of returning the rap- 
 ' turesthey beitow.'— — Thefe Jail words weie at- 
 tended with fucli vehement and repeated prel- 
 fures of the lips he praifed, as left her no room tt> 
 doubt the aim of his deliies, as did the manner of 
 receiving them, alfo convince him of his luccefs. 
 
 * But are you in earneft refolved to be a mm ?' 
 replif^d he : ' Since fate will have it lb,' replied 
 /lie, with a deep figh, and a look ft) lanpiiiilnng, 
 and fb fweet, as pierced his very foul : — — ' Make 
 
 * me your fate then,' cried he impatiently, — ' be 
 
 * mine, and not all the iainfs in the kalender fhall 
 
 * Iriatch you from me j' — 'You are then, you 
 
 * muft be my fate,' faid file, returning h;s cm- 
 brace with ecual eagernefs, 'you h.;ve t'ne- 
 
 ' power of fate, and are no lefs refidief^^, — iicnce- 
 
 * forth I'll leek no other heaven, but your love, 
 
 * your brealt my altar, and your arms my cell , 
 
 It will be eafily luppofed, that after this, flie 
 refufed no liberties he thought fit to take : — no- 
 thmg but the laft fivour was wanting to compleat 
 his wiihes, and to that he would not venture to 
 
 proceed, 
 

<#PG# 331>
Mifs Betsy Thoughtless. 323 
 
 proceed, for fear of an interiuptiun, but they a- 
 greed to meet at the Porniguele jmbaffkdor's cha- 
 pel at iix o' clock that fame evening. Mutual 
 Jcifles and embraces having I'eaied the covenant, 
 he went down to dreif, and lefc her to compofe 
 her countenance againft Mrs, Munden's reuirn. 
 
 This very wicked woman, who had never any 
 real thoughts of going into a monaiiery, and only 
 intended to appropriate the money ihe exptfled 
 from Mr. Thoughtlefs, to fjch ufes as might in- 
 duce fbme man of fortune to make choice of her 
 for a miftrefs, now gave herfelf littne pain, whe- 
 ther he granted her requcft or nor, imagining Hie 
 h?.d found in vir. Munclen all flie wiDied for, or 
 could hope in a gallant. 
 
 She affefled, however, to Mrs. Munden, to be 
 
 under fome concern for this delay of her intended 
 
 ■journey, but laid, ihe wordd employ the tin^e /he 
 
 ,. tiftaid, in luch a6ls of devotion, as Ihould beftpre- 
 
 u spare her to become a member of that lacred fo- 
 
 'ciety, which (he foon hoped to be among : ' I 
 
 ' have not been,' added Ihe, ' for a long time at 
 
 * conreffion, but I will go this afternoon, and eafe 
 
 * my confcience of its load of guilt,' 
 
 Thus impioufly did ihe prophane the name of 
 religion, by making it the veil to cover the moll 
 fliametul depravities (>f nature. — — On the arrival 
 of the appointed hour, with looks of fandlity, 
 land a heart full of impurity, flie hafted to the 
 place of rendezvous 3 the punftual Mr. Mundeti 
 waited for her at the ciiapel door, and conduced 
 •her where they had all the freedom they could 
 ^wiPn of indulging their vicious inclinations. 
 
 They broke off this fiifl amorous intercourie 
 -fnucli Iboner than either of them defired 5 riiade- 
 •moiielle de Roquelair not being able to find a 
 -plauiible excufe to make to Mrs, Munden for 
 staying beyond the time, which her pretended de- 
 votions 
 

<#PG# 332>
J24 77;^ HISTORY of 
 
 votions might be reafbnably fuppoled to take up j 
 but to attone for this misfortune, a Itratagem was 
 contrived between them, not only for their meet-, 
 ing next day, but alfb for their continuing toge-t: 
 ther a much longer time,-— it was this. 
 
 She told Mrs. Munden, that the reverend fa- 
 tlier, to whom fh^ had confeiTed, informed her, 
 that a young lady of a very worthy family in 
 England, having pafled her year of probation at a 
 monallery at Bologne, and returned hither only to 
 take an eternal leave of her friends, and of the 
 world, was now jufl ready to go back, in order to 
 he initiated : — — ' To this family,' added flie, ' th« 
 ' good father has offered to introduce me to-mor- 
 
 * row, and if the young lady approves of my being 
 
 * the companion of her voyage, as he affures me 
 
 * /he certainly will, how happy (hall I thinkmylelf,' 
 
 The truth of all this not being lulpedted by 
 Mrs. Munden, flie congratulated her upon it ^ it 
 is eafy to deceive the innocent, — but it muft be 
 owned, this wicked woman had fubtilry enough 
 to have impofed on a peribn more fxilled m the ar- 
 tifices of the world, than was the amiable lady on 
 whom fhe praflifed it. 
 
 But not to detain the reader's attention on fo un- 
 grateful a i'ubjeft, I I'lull only lay, that one affigna- 
 tion was dill productive of another, and the cre- 
 dulity of the injured wife ferved only as a matter 
 of miith to the tranfgreffing husband, and his 
 guilty partner. 
 
 But now the time was come when thefe iubter- 
 fuges muft neceffarily be at an end, or beconie too 
 grols not to be leen thro'. Mr. Thoughtlels had 
 leen his friend, — had paid the money imo his 
 ham's, and received a biU from him on the mer- 
 chant at Bologne 5 when he delivered it to Mrs. 
 Munden,— 'Sifter,' faid he, ' this paper wil' cn- 
 
 * title your gueft to the receipt of three hundred 
 
 louis-d'ors,

 * for it is neither conliftent with your reparation Ut 
 
 * keep her in your houfe, nor with my peace oF 
 
 * mind, that fhe fliould continue in the kin'^dnHi.' 
 To which file replied with a fmile, 'Thar these 
 ' was nothing more certain than that his CiMnminds, 
 
 * in this point would be punftuaily obeyed.' 
 
 This lady was rejoiced at having accompli flied 
 what flie thought io good a work ; but having 
 perceived in mademoilelle de Ro.]uel:dir fame 
 abatement of her firft eagernefs fur a religious 
 life, Ihe thought proper on giving her the bi!i to 
 repeat to her the words her brother h id laid on 
 that account j to which the other cooly anlvvered, 
 
 * Your brother, ir.adam, need be under no apcie- 
 ' henfions of my offending him in this po:nr, or 
 
 * giving you any farther trouble.' 
 
 This, though -no more than what the lovers ex- 
 pected, was yet a dreadful fhock to theni both : 
 gieat part of the time they were toge'iier that 
 evening, was taken up in talking of it j made- 
 moilelle de Roquelair protelled, rhar death was 
 Iv-fs cruel than being torn trom her doarMo.hden 
 thus early,—— thus in the infancy of riieir hippi- 
 nels ; and gave Ibme hints, that ihe wilhtd he 
 would hir^ private lodgings fjr he.-; but fhe knew 
 little of the temper of the mati fhe had to deal 
 with ; — -he loved her as a mifbefs, but hated the 
 expeiice of keeping her as a UMftrcirs, he thete- 
 fore cva.led all difcourfe on that liead, and told 
 her that he fancied th it by pretences, fuch as alrea- 
 dy-'v-d been made, fhe might ftill cmtinue in the 
 houfe, —• * means at lead,' faid he, ' may be found 
 ' out to protra6l our mutual misfi)rtune, and give 
 
 * us more tinie to con-fider what we have to do.'

 new invention from one day to another, for up- 
 wards of a week, but at laft beginning to fear 
 there was i'omething more at the bottom of thefe 
 delays than was pretended, and her brother hav- 
 ing lent twice in that time, to know if his defires 
 had been complied with, jfhe refblved at once to 
 put a period to inconveniencies, which /he thouglit 
 ihe could To eafily get rid of. 
 
 Mademoilelle de Roquelair having flayed a- 
 broad extremely late one night, fhe took the op- 
 portunity of her having done ih^ of fpeaking more 
 plainly to her than her good nature and complai- 
 lance had hitherto permitted her to do ^— fhe went 
 up to her chamber next morning, and with an air 
 which had fomething of Severity in it, — ' You 
 ' keep odd hours, madam,' faid flie, ' for a perfon 
 ' who afie^h to be lb great a penitent : but 1 fup- 
 
 * pofe you are now prepared to eale me of all 
 ' concern on your account : — * I fliall trouble you 
 
 * no longer,' cried the other, ' till the young lady 
 ^\ told yju of is ready to depart.' — ' You will do 
 ' well,' relumed Mrs. Munden, ' t© remain with 
 ' her till HiC is (b, for, madam, I muft infill: on 
 
 * your removal hence this day.'——' You will not 
 
 * turn me out of doors ?' cried mademoifelle de 
 Roquelair. — ' I hope you will not oblige me to 
 
 * an a(f>, lb contrary to my nature,' replied Mrs. 
 Munden. — ' Say rather contrary to your power,' 
 returned that audacious woman, and coming up 
 to her with the molt unparallelled alTurance, ' This 
 
 * houfe, which you forbid me,' purfued file, ' I 
 
 * think Mr. Munden is the mailer of, and I (hall 
 
 * theiefore continue in ir till my convenience calls 
 ' me from it, or he ihall tell me I am no longer 
 
 * welcome.' 
 
 ImpoiTible is it to defcribe, and difficult even 
 to conceive Mrs. Munden's aflonifhment at thefe 
 words : — — to hear a woman thus doubly loaded 
 
 with

 with' guilt and obligations, ——a woman, who but 
 a few days part had been proftrate at her feet, im- 
 ploring pity and proteftion, now all at once un- 
 gratefully contemning the benefits /he had re- 
 ceived, and infolently defying the authority to- 
 which fhe had flown for flielter 5 — all this muft 
 certainly give a fliock almoft beyond the rtrength 
 of human reafon to fultain. — — ' Mr. Munden/ 
 cried the injured fair one, with a voice hardly in- 
 telligible, 'Mr. Munden !' flie could urter no 
 more, but fl'iwdown ftairs with fuch rapidity that 
 her feet Icarce touched the fteps. 
 
 Mr. Munden was not quite ready to go out, •— ^ 
 ilie found him in hisdrefling-room, and throwing- 
 herfelf into a chair, half luffbcated with paffion, 
 related to him, as well as fhe was able, the manner 
 in which Jhe had been treated 5 to which he re- 
 plied, with a good deal of peevifhnefs, ' Prithee 
 do not trouble me with thefe idle itories, — Ma- 
 demoifelle de Roquelair is your gueft, — I have 
 no concern in your little quarrels.' — ' 1 hqpe/ 
 faid fhe, * you will do me that juftice which eve- 
 ry wife has a right to expe^, and convince that 
 French hypocrite, that I am too much the mif^ 
 trefs of this houfe for any one to remim in it 
 without my permiffibn.' — ' So you would make 
 me the dupe of your refentmeni,' refumed he 
 feornfully, ' but pofitively I fhall not do a rude 
 * thing to oblige you, or any body elfe.' — In fpeak- 
 ing thefe words, having now adjurted his drefs, 
 he flung out of the room, without giving her 
 time to add any thing farther on a llibj?(S he was 
 wholly unprepared to anfwer.

 She would not, however, do any thing preci-

 me /hould be juftified to herfelfj flie was willing 
 alfo to be juftified in the opinion of her friends : 
 her brother was the firft perfon to be onfulted, 
 fhe refolved therefore to go immediately to him» 
 but as it was neceflary to put fome things in order 
 before her departure, in cafe fhe fliould return no 
 more, fhe called the maid, who always waited on 
 her in her chamber, to affift her on this occafion. 
 
 She locked up her jewels, and what other 
 -trinkets fhe had of value in an amber cabinet, 
 and made her wearing apparel beallbdifpoled of 
 in proper utenfi^ls, leaving out only fome linnen, 
 and other neceflaries for the prefent u!e, which 
 fhe alio caufed to be pack'd up. — The poor 
 maid, who loved her miftrefs dearly, and eafily 
 guefled thi meaning of thefe preparations, could 
 not refrain weeping all the time fhe was thus 
 employed ; — — ' Ah, madam,' cried Ihe, ' what 
 *' a lad thing it is that married gentlemen will be

 Mrs. Munden then recollefted, that Mr. Mun- 
 den's man was in the room, when /he related the 
 behaviour of mad^moifelle de Roquelair, which 
 ihenow was not forry for, nor of the ftefli proof 
 given her by this maid of the perfidy of her h un-

 Mrs. Munden could not forbear fhedding tears 
 as (he was going into her chair, at the thoughts 
 of thi^ exile, voluntary as it was, from a houfe 
 /he had ft) much right to call her own 5 but the 
 poor maid roared out fo loud at feeing her depart, 
 that it brought all the fervants out of the kitchen 
 to know what was the matter, which being told' 
 by Jenny, occaHoned fo general a grief among

 poffible /he would have had little either of rei'peftj 
 or obedience from them. 
 
 But fortune /pared this mortification, in order 
 to inflidl: a much greater one on her ingratitude 
 and treacheiy.— Mr. Munden had not quitted* 
 the prefence of his wife many minutes before he' 
 broan to re/le^f ferioufly on this accident ; — he'

 as becaufe it plainly fhewed, that the other in- 
 -tended to pin herfelf upon him, and oblige him 
 to I'upport her 5 a thing which did not at all fiiit 
 with his humour : — he had gratified his paflion 
 almoit to a furfeir j — a very liitle longer time 
 -would have made him as heartily wifh to get rid 
 •of her, as ever he had done to gain her 5 and 
 though it could not be faid he was as yet altoge- 
 ther cloyed with the pleafures {lie fo lavifhly be- 
 -ftowed, yet a little examination into the extent 
 of his inclinations, convinced him, that he could 
 bear the lofs of iier for ever without pain. 
 
 While the blood runs high, and define is ram- 
 pant for poll cfljon, prudence is of little force J but 
 when the one begins to flag, the other refumesits

 nobody but mademoifelle de Roquelair herfelf", 
 and that it was probable, that gentleman, if told 
 the ufage had been given his filter, might be 
 provoked to recall his order, and prevent the 
 
 payment of it at all j this feemed, however, 
 
 3 plaufible pretence for peifuading her to go away 
 diredlly, and alio for making a merit to his wife 
 of what he did. 
 
 Having fully determined within himfelfhow 
 to proceed in this affair, he Ihortned his morning's 
 -walk, and came home (bme hours before the 
 ufual time : — — he was at firft a little fretted on 
 being told Mrs. Mnnden was gone to her brother's,

 miltrefs had laid to her, concerning her intentions 
 of coming back no more, he pafled it lightly 
 over, imagining her accufations and reproaches 
 would ceaie, the obje^ of them being once re- • 
 moved. 
 
 He found no difficulty in prevailing on made- 
 moifelle de Roquelair to go to Bologne. — — I'hree 
 hundred louis dors was too tempting a lum to be 
 forfeited meerly for the want of a little jaunt, e-

 plilh her bufinefs there, and return to London 
 within the compafs of a very few days, and he told 
 her, that he would hire lodgings for her againft 
 her coming back.

 upon for this expedition, he went himlelf to pro-

 at a place he mentioned to her in an hour at far- 
 theft. 
 
 As he promised to fend all her baggage to th«

 This double deceitful man, having a farther 
 view in what he did than llie had any notion of^ 
 told her at parting, that it would be proper for 
 her to ftay at Bologne till /he received a letter 
 from him with an account in whatftreet, and part 
 of the town, the lodgings he fhould provide for 
 her were firuated, to the end /he might come di- 
 red^ly into them on her arrival^-— he fpokc this 
 with an air lo full of tendeinefs and care for her 
 . repole, that {\\€: had not the leaft (ufpicion of his 
 drift, and replied, that /he would not fail to Jo 
 asheadvifed, but delircd he w<nild beasfbcedy 
 
 as poiTible in writing to her, ' for/ cried ihe^ 
 
 embracing him, ' I fhall thii^k every day a year 
 
 * till i return to the arms of my deir Munden.' 
 
 Having thus in reality dilcarded his miihefs, 
 though without her knov;ing he had done lc>, he 
 went home, in order to boart to his wife of the 
 complaifance he had /hewn to her in this affiir, 
 but finding /lie was not yet come back, he called 
 for her maid, and bid her tell her the moment 
 /he /hould return, that he had complied with her 
 requeft, and made the French woman go out of 
 the houfe. 
 
 After having /aid this, he went out again, and 
 came not home till late at night, when he was 
 confounded beyond mea/ure on finding a letter 
 from Mrs. Munden, which had been left for him 
 by her own footman in the begmning of the even- 
 ing, and contained thci'e lines. 
 
 To Mr. Munden. 
 
 ' Sir, 
 
 * A ^ y^" cannot but be fenfible, that the mutual

 ' final end to a way of life fo unpleafing in "the 
 
 * eyes of heaven, and fo difagreeable to ourfelves 5 
 
 * —it never was in my power to make you truly 
 
 * happy, nor in your will to make me even tolera- 
 
 * bly eafy ;— I therefore fly for ever from your 
 
 * ill ufage, and once more put myfelf under the 
 
 * proteftion of my friends, to whom I alfo /hall 
 
 * commit the care of fettling with you the terms

 * Your much injured wife, 
 
 ' B. MUNDEN. 
 
 * P. S. I have removed nothing out of your houfe 
 
 ' but what was my own before marriage.' 
 
 Upon enquiring farther into the matrer he was. 
 inf(M-med that Mrs. Munden bad indeed removed 
 a large India cheft, a buroe cabinet dreffingtable, 
 and in fine, every thing that belonged immediately 
 to herfelf, and alfo that his family was now re- 
 duced to two, her own man and maid having fol- 
 lowed her. 
 
 All this convincing him how much fiie was in 
 carneft, involved him in the mull perplexing co- 
 gitations 3— not that he regretted the parting with 
 her through any remains of afifeflion, or that his 
 barden'd heart was touched with a jurt fenfibility 
 of her merit, or with any repentance of his ill 
 treatment of her, but that he knev;' fuch an affair 
 Jiiuft neceflarily be attended with lome noife and 
 confufion, and in many refpedls give him a good 
 deal of embaraffment : •»— it was therefore thefe 
 two laft reafons, which alone determined him to 
 make ufe of all his artifice to bring about a lecond 
 i-econciJiation. 
 
 Thar beautiful lady in the mean time had 
 thoughts much more compoled 5 — her brother 
 had received her in the raoft afie6tionate manner,—

 had approved of her condii6l in regard to her un- 
 faithful husband,—— had affured her of the conti- 
 nuance of his friendfhip and prote^ion, and be- 
 fore fhe could requeft: it of him, invited her, and 
 inch of her fervants as (he choie fhould attend her, 
 to remain in his houfe as long as Hie ihould think 
 
 fit. He deiired her to take upon her the fole 
 
 command and management of his houfe and fa- 
 mily, and affigned the beft apartment for her par- 
 ticular life: — in fine he omitted nothing that 
 might convince her of a fincere welcome. 
 
 On dilcourfing together concerning her obtain- 
 ing a feparate maintenance, it was the opinion of 
 them both, that Mr. Markland the lawyer fhould 
 be advifed with, as he was a man who<:ouId not 
 but be well experienced in fuch affairs, and accord- 
 ingly a lervant was difpatched to that gentleman, 
 to defire he would come to them the next day. 
 
 But though fhehad reafon to be highly farisfied 
 with the reception given her by her brother, yet 
 ilie could not be quite eafy till flie fliould hear 
 what judgment her dear lady Loveit would pals 
 on the Hep Ihe had taken, — She went the next 
 morning to pay a vifit at that lady's toylet, — ihe 
 related to her fincerely every particular of the pro- 
 vocation rhe had received, the manner in which 
 fhe had refented it, and the refolution flie had ta- 
 ken of living in an etemal flateof ieparation from 
 fo bad a man 5 to which lady Loveit replied, that 
 though flie was extremely lorry for the occafion, 
 yet Ihe thought if (he had atled otherwife, it 
 would have been an injullice not only to herfelf, 
 but to all wives in general, by fetting them an ex- 
 ample of lubmitting to things required of them 
 neither by law nor nature. 
 
 This encouragement, from a lady of her known 
 fcrupulous dilpofition, made Mrs. Mmiden not

 * too juft a light to be eadly brought into any

 Though Mr. Munden wanted not cunning in 
 
 moft things, yet in writing this epiftle he Teemed 
 not to confider the fpirit, or the penetration of his 
 wife, who, he might have known, had too great 
 a fhare of both, to be either intimidated by the 
 majefterial air of fomeof the expreflions, or looth- 
 ed by the fawning, unfincere compliments of the 
 others. 
 
 This vain attempt therefore only ferving to re- 
 mind her of the many proofs Hie had received 
 both of his ill nature and deceit towards her, in- 
 ftead of weakening the refulution fhe had taken 
 of not living with him again, rather rendered it 
 more flrong and permanent.

 MR. Markland did not, like too many of his 
 profeffion, ever flatter bis clients with an 
 afllirance of fuccefs in any caufe, of which him- 
 lelfvv'as doubtful: — He plainly told Mrs. Mun- 
 den, that he feared not all the ill ufage ihe had 
 fuftained would be fufficient to compel her hui- 
 band to allow her a feparate maintenance. — ' Ho- 
 
 * nour and generofity may indeed,' added he, ' o- 
 
 * blige him to do that, which I am very appre- 
 
 * henflve the law will not enforce him to.' 
 
 * Alas,' cried Mrs. Munden, burfting into tears, 
 
 * if I can have no relief but from his honour and 
 
 * generofity, I mull be miferable.' — ' Not fo, my 
 ' dear fifter,' laid Mr. Thnughtlefs, ' while you

 It is not to be doubted but both the brothers and 
 the filter earneftjy intreated he would exert all his 
 abilities in an affair, which they eafily faw would 
 be difficult enough to manage j but the anlwers of 
 this honcit good natured gentleman fbon convinced 
 them, that there was no need of any perfuifiuns 
 to induce him to do every thing in his power for 
 the fervice of ill-treated mnocence. 
 
 Mrs. Munden having told him, that about eleven 
 o'clock was the moft certain time for her husband 
 to be Ipoke with, he went the next morning at 
 that hourj on lending up his name, Mr. Munden 
 gueffed the errand on which he came, but that

 * would afford to all her friends, who would 
 
 * doubtlefs have a itrift watch on your behaviour.* 
 
 Thefe words threw Mr. Mundtn into a deep 
 refverie, which the other would not interrupt, be- 
 ing willing to fee how far this lall remonltrance had 
 worked upon him, till coming out of it, and vexed 
 that he had /hewn any difcompofure, — ' Wellj

 * myfelf no pain about it, *— — but fhe mull not ex- 
 
 * peft I /hall allow one penny towards her main- 
 
 * tenance.' 
 
 It was on this head, that Mr. Markland found 
 he had occafion to employ all the rhetoric he was 
 mafter of; — he urged the unreafonablene/s,the 
 injuftice. the cruelty of denying the means of fub- 
 fiftance to a lady whofe whole fortune he enjoyed ;

 who on parting from their husbands, were allowed 
 a proviuon proportionable to the Turns they had 
 brought in marriage. 
 
 All thefe arguments were enforced in terms f(i 
 ftrong, and i'o pathetic, that Mr. iMundeu could 
 make no other anfwer than,*— that he did not 
 defire to part, that it was her own fault, and that 
 if (he would not return to her duty, fhe ought to 
 be ftarved into a more juft fenfe of ir^ and that he 
 was very fure the law would not compel him to 
 do any thing for her 5 on which, Mr. Markland 
 again reminded kim of the vexation, the fatigue, 
 the difgrace, with which a fuit commenced by 
 either party muft be attended, in whofe favour 
 foever the decifion (hould be made. 
 
 He talked fo long on this fubjtfl, that Mr. 
 Munden, either to get rid of him, or beciufe be 
 was really uncertain what to do, at lalt told him, 
 that he would confider on what he had been fay- 
 ing, and let him know his refolution in a week's 
 time, — Mr. Markland then replied, that he 
 would trouble him no farther for the prefent, and 
 after having prefixed a day for waiting on him 
 again, took his leave. 
 
 The Mind of Mr. Munden was indeed in the 
 urmoil confnfion amidft that variety of vexatious 
 incidents which he had now to ftruggle with, — — 
 the little probability he found there was of re-ef- 
 tablifhing himfelf in the favour of his patron,*— 
 
 the lofs of all his hopes that way, the fudden 
 
 departure of a wife, whom, tho' he had no af- 
 feaionfor, he looked upon as a necefiary appendix 
 to his houfe, — — the noife her having taken fuch 
 a Hep would make in the town, the apprehenfions 
 of being obliged to grant her a feparate mainte- 
 nance, all thefe things put together, it is certain 
 were lufficient to overwhelm a man of a lefs ita^

 as having been the eaufe of this lafl misfortune 
 falling on him, and to prevent all farther trouble 
 on her account, ordered, that the luggage file had 
 left behind fiiould be immediately put on board 
 a veflel, and fent after her to Bologne ; he alfo 
 wrote to her at the fame time, acquainting her 
 with the difturbance which had happened, and 
 that it was highly neceflary for his future peace 
 that he fiiould lee her no more, nor even hold 
 any correfponv?ence with her. 
 
 Mrs. Munden in the mean time was far from 
 being perfectly cafy, though Mr. Markland gave 
 her hopes that her husband would very fpeedily 
 be brought to fettle things between them in a rea- 
 fbnable way, and her brother was every day give- 
 ing her freih aflurances of his friendfiiip and pro- 
 teiiion, whether that event proved favourable or 
 not ; yet all this was not enough to quell fome 
 fcruples, which now rofe in her mind 5— the vio- 
 lence of that paffion, which had made her refolve 
 to leave Mr. Munden being a little evaporated, 
 the vows file had made to him at the altar were 
 continually in her thoughts j — fiie could not quite 
 alTure herfelf, that a breach of that folemn cove- 
 nant was to be juftified -by any provocations 5 nor 
 whether the worlt ufage on the part of the huf- 
 iand could authorize refentment in that of a wife. 
 
 She was one day disburdening her difquiets on 
 this fcore to her dear lady Loveit, in terms which 
 made that lady fee more than ever fiie had done 
 before, the height of her virtue, and the delicacy 
 of her fentiments, when fir Bazil came haftily in- 
 to the room with a paper in his hand, and after 
 paying his compliments to Mrs. Munden, ' My 
 ' dear,' laid he to his lady, * I have very agreeable 
 » news to tell you, — I have juft received a letter 
 « from my brother Trueworth, which informs me,

 * that he is upon the road, and we /hall have hini

 replied flie, ' and likewise that he is fo good to 
 
 * let us know it, that I may make fome litile pre-

 Mrs. Munden could not be told that Mr. True- 
 worth was ib near, and might prefently he in the 
 fame room with her, without the utmolt confufi-

 nifhed her with, of taking her leave, and rifing 
 haftily up, * I will wait on your ladyfhip,' laid

 their efforts, and defiring to be excufed flaying

 MRS. Munden was fo ignorant of her own 
 heart, in relation to what it felt on Mr. 
 Trueworth's account, that Hie imagined ihe had 
 only fled his prefence becaufe fhe could not bear 
 a man who had courted her fb long, fliould fee her 
 thus unhappy by the choice /he had made of ano- 
 ther. 
 
 ' I am well affured, cried fhe, ' that he has too 
 ' much generofity to triumph in my misfortune, 
 ' and too much complailance to remind me of the 
 
 * caufe 3—- yet would his eyes tacitly reproach my 
 
 * want of judgment, — and mine too might per- 
 
 * haps, in fpite of me, confefs, as the poer fays, that 
 
 " I, like the child, whole folly proved its lols, 
 ." Refufcd the gold, and did accept the drofs." 
 This naturally leading her into fome ref^e61ions 
 on the merit of Mr. Trueworth, fhe could not 
 Kelp wondering, by what infatuation fhe had been 
 governed, when rejefting him, or what was tanta,- 
 mount to rejefting hmi, treating him in fuch a 
 manner as might make him defpair of being ac- 
 cepted.—* Vv bat though my heart was infenfible 
 
 * of love, faid flie, niy reafon,— -nay my very

 ' envy of my own lex, and excited the efteem and 
 ' veneration of the other.'— -Thinking ftili more

 deeply,-— 'O God, cried fhe, with vehemence, 
 
 * to what a height of happinefs might I have been 
 
 * railed ! And into what an abyls of wretchednefs 
 'am I now plunged !—— Irretrievably undone, 
 
 * married without loving or being loved, loft in

 . Nothing fo much fharpens the edge of aiBi^lion 
 as a confcioufneis of having brought it upon our- 
 felves J to remember that all we could wifti for, 
 •—all that could make us truly happy, was once in 
 our power to be poflefled of, and wantonly Ihun- 
 ning the good that heaven and fortune offered, we 
 headlong run into the ills we mourn, renders them 
 doubly grievous. 
 
 This being the cafe with our heroine, how ought 
 all the fair and young to guard againft a vanity fo 
 fatal to a lady, who but for that one foible, had 
 been the happieft, as fhe was in all other refpefts, 
 the moft deferving of her fex ! — • But to return. 
 
 A juft lenfibility of the errors of her paft coH' 
 du6l, joined with ibme other emotions, which the 
 reader may eafily guefsat, though ifhe as yet knew 
 not the meaning of herfelf, gave her but little re- 
 pofe that night 5 and pretty early the next morning 
 /he received no inconfiderable addition to her per- 
 plexities. 
 
 The time, in which Mr.Munden had promifed 
 to give his anfwer to the lawyer, was now near 
 expired, yet was he as irrefolute as ever ; —— loth 
 he was to have the affair between him and his wife 
 made public, and equally loth to comply with 
 her demands 5 — before he did either, it therefore 
 came into his bead to try what effeft menaces 
 would produce, and accordingly wrote to her in 
 thefe terms.

 This letter very much alarmed both the lifter

 ficers of jullice, and the latter could not but be un- 
 eafy that a difturbance of this kind /hould happen* 
 in his houfe : — they were jaft going to lend for 
 Mr. Markland to confuir him on what w.is to be

 Mrs. Munden teftif\ing as much facisfaflion at 
 this propofal as a peifin in her ciicurnlLmces 
 could be capable of feeling, Mr. Mirklind told 
 her, that he wis ready to condisfl her immediate-

 fifter fafe to her new abode, they all fet out toge-. 
 thee on their little voyage, Mrs. Munden having 
 firfl given diredl ons to her fervanrs where they 
 il"LOuId follow her with fuch things, as flie thought 
 would be wanted during her (tav there. 
 
 On th-jir arrival they found Mr. Markland had 
 fpoken very modellly of the place he recommend- .

348 The HISTORY of . 
 
 They all dined together that day, and, on part-, 
 ing, it was agreed, that Mrs. Munden /hould lend 
 her man every morning to town, in order to bring 
 her intelligence of whatever accidents had hap- 
 pen'd, in relation to her afiFair, on the preceding day. 
 
 As much as this lady had been rejoiced at the 
 kind reception fhe had met with from her brother 
 render her misfortunes, fhe was now equally pleas'd 
 at being removed for a time from him, not only 
 becaufe flie thought herfelf fecure from any infults 
 might be offered by her husband, but alfo becaufe 
 this private recefs feemed a certain defence againfl 
 the fight of Mr. Trueworth ; — a thing flie knew 
 not well how to have avoided in town, without 
 breaking oflT her acquaintance with lady Loveit. 
 
 After the gentlemen were gone, the filler in 
 law of Mr. Markland led her fair guefl into the 
 garden, which before fhe had only a curfory view 
 of 5 — fhe fhewed her among many other things, 
 feveral curious exotic plants, which /he told her 
 fhe had procured from the nurfieries of fome per- 
 fons of condition, to whom fhe had the honour 
 to be known ; but Mrs. Munden being no great 
 connoif^--ur that way, did not take much notice of 
 what fhe faid concerning them, till coming to the 
 lower end, flie perceived a little wicket gate,— 
 ' To where does this lead ? ' cried flie : ' I will 
 
 * fhew you prefently, madam,' replied the other, 
 and plucking it open, they both entered into a grafs 
 walk, hemmed in on each fide with trees, which 
 feemed as old as the creation 5— they had not 
 gone many paces, before an arbour, erefied be- 
 tween two of thefe venerable monuments of an- 
 tiquity, and overfpread with jeflamines and honey- 
 fuckles, attrafted Mrs. Munden's eyes.— 'Oh how 
 
 * delightful is this 1 fkid fhe : — ' It would have 
 
 * been much more fo, tnadam, if it had been placed

 * fee my reafons for it,' continued flie, 'if you 
 ' plcafe to turn your eyes a little to the righr.' — 
 Mrs. Muoden doing as fhe was defired, had the 
 profpe<5l of a very beautiful .garden, decorated. with 
 plots of flowers, ftatues, and trees cut in a moll 
 elegant manner. — — ' Does all this belon?, to you,* 
 demanded fhe, fomewhat I'urprized ? — ' No, ma- 
 
 * dam,' anfwered the other, *but they are part of 
 ' the fame eftate, and at prelent rented by a gen- 
 ' tleman of condition, wno lives at the next door : 
 
 * — the walk we are in is alfo common to us both, 
 
 * each having a gate to enter it at plealure, though 
 ' indeed they little frequent it, having much finer 
 
 * of their own.'. -With fuch lij<e chat t!<ey be- 
 guiled the time till the evening dew reminded 
 them it was beft to quit the open air, 
 
 Mrs. Munden paGed this night in more tranquil- 
 lity than ilie had done many preceding ones 3 — 
 fhe awoke however much -iooner than was her 
 cuftom, and finding herfelf lefs difpofed to return 
 to the embraces of ileep than to partake that fe- 
 licity /he heard a thouland chearful birds tuning 
 their little throats in praife of, fhe role, and wenc 
 down into the garden :—— the contemplative hu- 
 mour fhe was in, led her to the arbour fhe had 
 been fo much charmed with the night before 5 — 
 /he threw herfelf upon the moffy fear, where 
 Icenting the tragrancy of the fweets around her^ 
 made more delicious by the frefhnels of the morn- 
 ing's gale — — ' how delightful - • • how heavenly,*

 * knew the change that a little time has wrought 
 
 * in me ! he would certainly find me now more

 * lenfible of my real fentimei^ts, and if fir Bazil,

 ' juil fenfibility of his amiable qualities, and of the

 With thele reflections /}-,e took Mr. Trueworth's 
 picture, which flie always carried about her, and 
 looking on it with the greateft tendcrnels, * Tho' 
 
 * I no more muft lee himfelf,' faid fhe, ' I may at

 inftant, a thoufand proofs of love given hcrby the 
 original of the copy in her hand occurring all at 
 once to her remembrance, tears filled her eyes, 
 and her brealt fwelled wifh involuntary fighs. 
 
 In this painfully pleafing amulement did fine 
 contiiiue for lome tmie, and had doubtlels done 
 fo much longer, if a fudden ruflling among the 
 leaves behind her, had not nude her turn her head 
 to fee what had occafioned it j — but where are 
 the wnrds that can expreis the lui prize, the wild 
 confufion Ihe was in, when the firll glance of her 
 eyes preltnted her with the fight of the real ob-

 her, (lie funk from the feat where Hie was fittingj 
 and had certainly quite fainted away, but for the 
 immediate affiftance of the peifon, who had 
 caufed thefe extraordinary emotions.*' 
 
 Her fancy indeed, lirong as it was, had formed 
 no vifionary appearance : it was the very identical 
 Mr. Truewortb, whom chance had brought to 
 make the difcoyery of afecret, which of all things 
 in the world he had the leaft fufpicion of. 
 
 He was intimately acquainted with the perfon, 
 to whom the houfe adjoining to that where Mrs. 
 Munden lodged belonged, and hearing n'here he 
 was, on his return from Oxfordl'hire, bad come 
 the evening before, intending to pais a day or two 
 with him in this agreeable recefs. 
 
 As he was never a friend to much fleeping, he 
 ro(e that morning, and went down into the garden 
 before the greatefl part of the family had quitted 
 their beds j he faw Mrs. Munden while at too 
 great a diftance to know who fhe was, }et did 
 her air and motion as fhe walked, rtrike him with 
 famething, which made him willing to fee what 
 fort of face belonged to fo genteel a form 5— — 
 drawing more near, his curiofity was gratified 
 with a fight he little expected : —he was juft 
 about to accoft her with the falutations of the 
 morning, when Hie went into the aruour, and 
 IVated herfeif in the manner already delcribed : — 
 the extreme penfivenefs of her mind had iiindered 
 her from perceiving, that any one was near; but 
 the little covert under which fhe was placed being 
 open on both fides, be had a full view of every 
 thing Hie did : —— though flie was in the mo(t ne- 
 gligent night-drefs that could be, ihe feemed as 
 lovely to him as ever j all his firft flames rekindled 
 in his heart, while gazing on her with this unin- 
 terrupted freedom,—- he longed to fpeak to her,

 lerving /he had lomething in her hand, which 
 fl;e leemed to look upon with great attention, and 
 ri-nieiimes betrayed agitations he had never feen 
 in her before, he was impatient to difcover if pol- 
 
 fible the n^otive,- he therefore advanced as 
 
 gently as he could towards the back of the arbour, 
 which having no wood-work, and the leafy cano- 
 ].y only fupported by ozier boughs, placed at a 
 good diftance from each other, he had a full op- 
 portunity of beholding all that the reader has 
 been told ; — but what was his amazement to 
 find it was his own picture,! that very picture, 
 which h^ been taken from the painter's, was the 
 cbjeft of her meditations ! -*— he heard her fighs,

 as he was to her, he even drained his fight to be 
 more fure, and forgetting all the precautions he 
 had taken, thruft himfelf as far as he was able 
 between the branches of which the arbour was 
 compofed. 
 
 On perceiving the efFe£l this laft a£lion had 
 produced, the gate, though not above twenty 
 paces off, leemed too flow a paflfage to fly to her 
 relief, and letting his foot upon a pedcftal of a 
 flatue, quick as thought, or the flafh of elemental 
 fire, fprang over the myrtle hedge that parted the 
 garden from the walk, — ' Ah, madam,' cried he, 
 catching her in his arms to hinder her from fall- 
 ing,-—' what has the unhappy Trueworth done

 Gould not forbear f'miling at the fimplicty of the 
 wench, but willing to be rid of her, rewarded her 
 honefty with a crown piece, and difmifs'd her. 
 
 She was rt-j liced indeed to have this picture

 As to Mrs. Munden, /he found that flie bad no

 very difficult to refrain wifliing to be for ever with

 Thisflie thought fo highly criminal in herfelf, 
 that /lie ought not to indulge the remembrance of

 when Hie confidered, that meerly for her fake, 
 and not through the weak refiftance fiie had made,

 ' Oh bad I fooner known thy wondrous virtue, 
 
 ' Thy love, thy truth, thou excellent young

 * We might have both been happy. 
 
 But to banifh as much as poffible all thofe ideas^

 ——'no letter nor mefl'a^e fiom Mr. Mundcn, 
 having been left for her at her brother's, on which 
 file began to imagine, that he never had in reality

 a feint to put off giving him an anfwer as he had

 were of the lame opinion when they heard it. — — 
 Mr. Markland went again and again, however, 
 but was [till denied accefs 5—— near a whole: week 
 paffing over in this manner, Mrs. Munden grew 
 very uneafy, fearing /he /imuld be able to obtain 
 as little juftice, as favour from her husband. 
 
 But guilty as he iiad been in other refpe^ts, he 
 was intirely innocent in this;— —the force of the 
 agitation he had of late fuflained, joined to repeat- 
 ed debau<;ues, had over-heated his blood, and 
 thrown him inro a very violent fever, in fo much 
 that in a few days his life was defbaired of: — — 
 the whifpers of all about him, — the looks of tiie 
 phyfician that attended him, and above all what 
 he felt within himfelf, convincing him of the dan- 
 ger he was in, all his vices, — his excefles now 
 appeared to him Inch as they truly were, and filled 
 him with a remorfe, which he had been but too 
 much addi6ied to'redicule in others; — in fine, 
 the horrors of approaching difiolution rendered 
 him one of thoie many examples, which daily 
 verify thefe words of Mr. Dryden 3 
 
 ' Sure there. are none but fenr a future flate ! 
 
 * And when the moll obdurate fwear they do 
 
 not, 
 
 * Their trembling hearts bely their boafling

 AtTiong the number of thofe faults, which pre-

 the ill treatment he had given a wife, who fo

 Not all the indifference fhe had for the perlon 
 of Mr. Munden,- not all the refentment his 
 morofenefs and ill-nature had excited in her, 
 could hinder her from feeling an extreme fhock 
 on hearing his life was in danger j— fhe fought 
 for no excules, either to evade, or delay what he 
 defired of her j flie went direflly to him, equally 
 inclined to do fo by her compaflion, as flie thought 
 herfelf obliged to do by her duty. 
 
 As fhe entered the chamber flie met the apo- 
 thecary coming out 5—^ in afking him fome 
 queftions, though 'i\\^ fpoke very low, Mr. Mun- 
 den thought he diftinguifhed her voice, and cried 
 out as loud as he was able, ' Is my wife here ?* On 
 which approaching the bed, and gently opening 
 one of the curtains,——' Yes, Mr. Munden/ re- 
 plied flie, ' I am come to offer you ^11 the affiilance

 ' In my power, and am forry to i^nd you are in any

 ilretched out one of his hands towards her, which 
 file took between her's with a great deal of ten-

 he, * I have greatly wronged you, but forgive

 ' Then you will not leave me,' cried he 5 ' Never,' 
 anfwered (he, ' unleis your behaviour fhall con-

 Here he began to make foiemn proteflations 
 of future amendnient, but his voice failing him 
 through extreme weaknefs, a deep ligh, and ten- 
 der prefTure of his cheek to her's as ?he leaned 
 her head upon the pillow, gave her to underftand

 Here he preffed his face clofe to her's again, in 
 token of the fiitisfaiSion he felt in hearing what 
 fhe faid, and the nurfe who attended him that 
 inftant, prefenting him with iorti3 things the phy- 
 fician had ordered fliould be given him about that

 made a lign that he would do f) 5 — and the cur- 
 tains being drawn, they both retired to the farthvir 
 'end of the room. 
 
 As he lay pretty quiet for a conflderable time, 
 Mrs. Munden recoUeilred, that there was a thing, 
 which friendfhip and good manners exaited from

<#PG# 370>
562 The HISTORY of 
 
 her : — fhe had wrote the very day before a let- 
 ter to lady Loveit, acquainting her with the mo- 
 tive, which had obliged her to quit her brother's 
 houfe, and defiring fhe would favour her with a 
 vifit as foon as convenience would permit, at 
 the place of her retirement.— « As /lie doubted 
 not but the good nature of this lady would prevail 
 on her to comply with her requeft, flie could not 
 difpenfe with fending her an mimediate account 
 of the fudden revolution in her affairs, and the 
 accident which had occafioned this fecond re- 
 moval. 
 
 She had no fooner difpatched a little billet for 
 this purpofe, than the groans of Mr. Munden tef- 
 tifying that he was awake, drew both her and 
 the nurle again to the bediide : — they found him 
 in very great agonies, and without the power of 
 fpeech J the dodor and apothecary were fent for 
 in a gieat hurry, but before either of them came., 
 the unhappy gentleman had breathed his laft. 
 
 Mrs. Munden had not afFe(^ed any thing more 
 in this interview than what ilie really h\t 5— her 
 virtue and her compaffion had all the effeft on 
 her that love has in mofl: others of her fex ; fhe 
 had been deeply troubled at finding her husband 
 in fo deplorable a fituation 5 the tendernefs he 
 had now exprefled for her, and his contrition for 
 his paft faults, made a great impreffion on her 
 mind, and the fliock of feeing him depart was 
 truly dreadful to her; — the grief fhe appeared 
 in was undifTen^bled — the tears flie fhed un- 
 forced ; file withdrew into another room, where 
 .fhutting herfelf up for fbme hours, life, death, 
 and futurity were the fubjeds of her meditations.

 ividow, duri/jgthe fpjce oj a whole year, leiffy 
 fome other particulars of lefs moment. 
 
 MR. Thoughtleis was not at home when the 
 news of Mr. Munden's death arrived, but 
 when he was informed of it, he went to his fiiter, 
 and on finding her much more deeply affeiSed at 
 this accident than he could have imagined, pref- 
 fed her in the moll; tender terms to quit that fcene 
 of mortality, and return to his houfe :•— the per- 
 fuafions of a brother, who of late had behaved' 
 with fo much kindneJs towards her, prevailed on 
 her to accept of the invitation, and hav)n» given 
 Ibme neceCiiy orders in regard to the family, was 
 carried away that fame night in a chair with the 
 curtains clofe drawn. 
 
 She. faw no company however, till after the fu- 
 neral, and when tnat was over, lady Loveit was 
 the firft admitted. — As Mrs. Munden was ilill 
 under a great dejection of fpirits, wiiich was vi- 
 fible in her countenance, * If I did not know 
 
 * you to be the fincereft creature in the world,' laid 
 lady Loveit, ' I fliould take you to be the great- 
 
 * eft diflembler in it, — for it would be very dif- 
 
 * ficult for any one lefs acquainted with you to be- 
 
 * lieve you could be really afflifted at the death of 
 
 * a perlon, whofe life rendered you fo unhappy.' 
 
 * Miftake me not, dear lady Loveit,' anfwered 
 fhe, ' I do not pretend to lament the death of Mr. 
 
 * Munden, as it deprives me of his fociety, or as 
 
 * that of a perfon with whom I could ever hav& 
 
 * enjoyed any great fhare of felicity, even though

 ' living, and whom decency requires me to mourn

 * So then,' cried lady Loveir, * I find you take 
 
 * as much pains to grieve for a bad husband, as 
 
 * thofe who have th€ misfortune to iofe a good one 
 ' do, to alleviate their Torrows j — * but my dear,' 
 continued fhe with a more ferious air, — ' I fee no 
 
 * occafion for all this: — I am well affiired, that 
 
 * your virtue and the IWeetnefs of your temper 
 
 * enabled \ou todifcharge all the duties of a wife 
 
 * to Mr. Islunden while alive, and with that I think 
 
 * you ought to be content : — he is now dead, the 
 
 * covenant between you is diflolved, heaven has 
 
 * releaied you, and I hope forgiven him, — dc-

 ' but it does not reftrain you from being eafy in 
 
 * yourfelf, and chearful with your friends,' 
 
 ' Your ladyfliip ipeaks right,' faid Mrs. Mun- 
 den, ' but yet there is a fiiock in death, which 
 
 * one cannot preientjy get over. < I grant there 
 
 ' is,' replied iady Loveir, * and if we thought too 
 
 * deeply on it, we fhould feel all the agonies of 
 
 * that dreadful hour before our time, and become 
 
 * a burden to ourfelves and to the world.' 
 
 It is certain, indeed, that the lurprize and pity 
 for Mr, Mundefi's fudccn and unexpeded fate, had 
 at the firil overwhelmed her foul, yet when thole 
 emotions were a little evaporated, flie rather in- 
 dulged aifli61:ion, becaufe fhe thought it her duty 
 to do fo, than endeavoured any way to combat 
 with lit. 
 
 It was not therefore very difficult to reafon her 
 out of a melancholly, which ihe had in a manner 
 forced upon herfelf, and was far from being natu- 
 ral to her, and when once convinced, thst flie

 ought to be eafy under this flroke of providence 
 became entirely fo. 
 
 The painful tailc /lie had impofed upon her 
 mind being over, more agreeable ideas fucceeded : 
 —-the remembrance of Mr. Trueworfh,— his 
 recovered love, ——the knowledge he had of hers, 
 and the confideration that now both of rheni were 
 in a condition to avow their mutual tendernefs 
 without a crime, could not but transfufc; a fenla- 
 tion more pleafing than /he had ever before been 
 capable of experiencing. 
 
 In the meantime, that gentleman paflcd through 
 a variety of emotions on her account, nor will it 
 feem ftrange he fhould do ffj to any one, who 
 cafts the leaft retroi'peft on his former behaviour j 
 - — he had loved her from the firft moment he 
 beheld her, and had continued to love her for a 
 long feries of time with fuch an excels of piflion, 
 that not allhisreafon on her ill treatment of him, 
 and her fuppofed unworthineis, was I'carce lliinci- 
 ent to enable him wholly to defili: — anew a- 
 mour was requilire to divide his wifhes;— — the 
 fondnefs and artful blandifhments of Mils Flora, 
 lerved to wean his heart from the once darling ob- 
 jetS, but there demanded no lels than the amiable 
 perlbn, and more amiable temper of Mils Harriot 
 to drive thence an idea fo accuflomed to prelide : 
 
 ■ all this however, as it appeared, did not . 
 wholly extinguiih the fitft flame j— the inno- 
 cence of the charming Mifs Betfy fully cleared, 
 all the errors of her condu6t reformed, rekindled 
 iu him an efteem 3 — the iight of her after fo ma- 
 ny months ablence, made the feemingly dead 
 embers of defire begin to glow, and on the dis- 
 covery of her fentiments in his tavour, burft forth 
 
 into a blaze: he was not mafterof himleifin

see The HISTORY of 
 
 the manner the reader has been already told, and 
 for which he afterwards feverely condemned him- 
 lelf, as thinking he ought to be content with 
 knowing fiie loved him, v.'ithout putting her mo- 
 defty to the bluHi by letting her perceive the dif- 
 covery he had made. 
 
 As lady Loveit, without fufpefting the effefl 
 which her dilcourfe produced, had been ofien 
 talking of the ill treatment ilie received from Mr. 
 .Munden, and the nccefTity fiie had been under of 
 quitting his houfe, — the fincere veneration he 
 now had tor her, made him fimpathize in all the 
 difquiets he was fenfible flie fuftained : — but 
 when he heard this cruel husband was no more, 
 and at the fame time was informed in what man- 
 ner Ihe behaved, both in his lafl: moments, and 
 after his deceafe, nothing, not even his love, 
 could equal his admiration of her viriue and her ' 
 prudence. 
 
 What would he not now have given to have 
 feen her ? but he knew fuch a thing was utterly 
 impracticable, and to attempt it might lole hini 
 all the tendernefs Ihe had for him ,— ' his impa- 
 tience however would not InfFer him to feem al- 
 together paffive, and unconcerned at an evenr of 
 fo much moment to the happinefs of them both, 
 and he refolved to write, but to find terms to ex- 
 prefs himfelf fo as not to offend either her delica- 
 cy, by feeming too prefuming, or her tendernefs, 
 by a pretended indifference, coif him Ibme pains : 
 but at length he dictated the following billet. 
 
 To Mrs. MtJNDEN. 
 
 ' Madam,

 ' deeply interefted in every thing that regards you,

 Thefe few lines perhaps, ferved more to raife 
 the ipirits of Mrs. Munden than all flae could re- 
 ceive Uova any other quarter 5 — — flie neverthe- 
 lefs perlcvered in maintaining the decorum of her 
 condition, and as {'wt had reiblved to retire imo 
 
 L e in cafe of a feparation from her husband, 
 
 flie thought it moll proper to i:x her relidence m 
 that place in her llate of widowhood, at lealt fur 
 the £ii\ year of if. 
 
 Accordingly flie wrote to lady Trufly to ac- 
 quaint her with her intentions, and received an 
 anfwer fuch as fhe expefied, full of pi-aifes of 
 her cop.dii£i- in this point, and the moll preffing 
 invitations to come down with all the Ipeed flie 
 eould. 
 
 What little bafinefs Vao. had in London was foon 
 difpatched, and all was ready for her quitting it 
 within a month after the death of Mr. Munden : 
 ■ places for herfelfand maid were taken in the 
 ftage coach,- — all her thin-^.s were packed up, 
 and fent to the inn ,— *— Ihie thought nothing now 
 remained but to rake leave of lady Loveir, whom 
 fhe expelled that faiBe evening, being the lafl /he 
 was to Itay in town ; but near as her departure \vis^ 
 forfuns in the mean time had contrived an acci- 
 dent, 
 

<#PG# 376>
$6t r/^tf H I S T O R Y of 
 
 dent, which put all her fortitude, and prefence of 
 mind to as great a trial, as file hatl ever yet fuf- 
 tained. 
 
 Lady Loveit having got a cold, had com- 
 plained of fome little diforder the day before, 
 and though nothing could be more flight than her 
 indifpofition, yet as flie was pretty far advanced 
 in her pregnancy, the care oF her phyfician, and 
 the tendernefs of fir Bazil, would not permit her 
 by any means to expofe herlelf to the open air. 
 
 MrS; Munden being informed by a meflenger 
 from her of what had happened, found herlelf 
 under an abfolute neceffity of waiting on her, as 
 it would have been ridiculous and prepolterous, 
 as well as unkind, to have quitted the town for 
 £o long a time without taking leave of a friend 
 fuch as lady Loveit. 
 
 She could not think of going there without re- 
 flefting at the fame time how ftrong a probability 
 there was of meeting Mr. Trueworth ;— fhe 
 knew indeed that he did not live at fir BazilV, 
 having heard he had lately taken a houfeforhim- 
 felf, but Ihe knew alio, that his clofe connexion 
 with that family made him leldom let flip a day 
 without feeing them ; — • flie therefore prepared 
 herfelf as well as flie was able for fuch an inter- 
 view, in cafe it fliould i'o happen. 
 
 That gentleman had dined there, and on find- 
 ing lady Loveit was forbid going abroad, and fir 
 Bazil unwilling to leave her alone, had conlented 
 to llay with them the whole day : — they were 
 at ombre when Mrs. Munden came, but on her 
 entrance threw afide the cards ^— lady Loveit 
 received her according to the familiarity between 
 them, and fir Bazil with little lefs freedom, but 
 Mr. Trueworth faluted her with a more diftant 
 air J — 'I had not the honour, madam,' laid he, 
 ' to make you any compliments on either of the 
 
 ' great 
 

<#PG# 377>
Mifs Betsy TH0UG-iiTLEs«. ^9 
 
 * great changes you have undergone, but you have 
 
 * always had my bed wifhes for your profpcriry.' 
 
 Mrs. Munden, who had pretty well armed her- 
 felf for this encounter, replied with a voice and 
 countenance tolerably well compofed, — ' Great 
 ' changes indeed, fir, have happened to us both 
 
 * in a Hiort I'pace of time.'— ' There has fo, ma- 
 ^ dam,' icfumed he, ' but may the next you meet 
 
 * with bring with it Jafting happinefs !' — She ca- 
 fily compreiiended tlie meaning of thele words, 
 but made no ani'wer, being at a' lofs what to fay, 
 which might neither too much embolden, nor 
 wholly difcourage the motive, which diftattd 
 them. 
 
 After this, the converfation turned on various 
 lubjeiSs, but chiefly on that of Mrs. Munden's 
 going out of town :— — Mr. Trueworth faid little j 
 lady Loveit, though fiie expreffed an infinite 
 deal of forrow for the loft of fo amiable a com- 
 panion, could not forbear applauding her refolu- 
 tion in this point,but fir Bazil would fain have been 
 a little pleafant on theoccafion, if the grave looks 
 of Mrs. Munden had not put his raillery to filence. 
 ■Perceiving the day was near fnut in, Ihe rofe 
 to take her leave 5 it was in vain that they ufed all 
 imaginable arguments to perfuade her to ftay iup- 
 per 5 /lie told them, that as the coach went out 
 io early, it was necefifary for her to take Ibme re- 
 pofe, before flie entered upon the fatigue of her

 tice of her plea, and faid no more. 
 
 The parting of thefe ladies was very moving, 
 they embraced again and again, promifed to write 
 frequently to each other, and mingled tears as ihey 
 exchanged farewels. — Sir Bazil, who had really 
 a very high eftecm for her, was greatly afre(51ed, 
 in fpite of the giiety of his temper, on bidding 
 her adieu J and happy was it for Mrs. Munden, that

 the concern they both were in hindered them from 
 perceiving that confiifion, that diftraSion of mind, 
 which neither flie, nor Mr. Trueworth were able 
 to reftraiiv totally the marks of, as he approached 
 to make her thofe compliments, which might 
 have been expefted on fuch an occaiion, even from 
 a perfon the moft indifferent : his tongue, indeed, 
 littered no more than words of courfe, but his lips 
 trembled while faluting her 5 nor could flie in 
 that inilant withhold a figh, which feemed to rend 
 her very heart ,— their mutual agitations wexe in 
 fine too great not to be vifible to each other, and 
 left neither of them any room to doubt of the ex- 
 treme force of the paffion from which they fprang.. 
 
 The motive, which had made her refui'e Itaying 
 fupper at fir Bazil's, was to prevent Mr. Trueworth- 
 from having any pretence to wait upon her home, 
 not being able to anfwer how far (he could fup- 
 porf her charsdler, ifexpofed to the tender things 
 he might p ;ffibly addrels her with on luch an op- 
 portunity, and fhe now found by what /he had 
 felt on parting with him, how neccffaiy the pre- 
 caution was that fhe had taken. . 
 
 After a night lefs engrofled by fleep than medi- 
 tation, file let out for L— — — e, where flie ar- 
 rived without, any ill accident to retard her jour- 
 ney, and was received by fir Ralph and lady 
 Trufty with all thole demonftrations of joy, which 
 fhe had reafon to expeiSl from rhe experienced 
 fiiendflaip of thofe worthy perfans. 
 
 As this was the place of her nativity, and her 
 father had always lived there in very great efii- 
 roation, the houle of ladyTrufty at firft was throng- 
 ed with perfons of almoft all conditions, who 
 Came to pay their compliments to her fair gueft 5 
 and as no circumflance, no habit could take from 
 her thofe charms, which nature had beftowed up- 
 en her, her beauty and amiable equalities foon be- 
 came

 came the theme of converfation through the whole 
 county. 
 
 She was not infenfible of the admiration fhe 
 attradeJ, but was now far from being elated with 
 it : — all the fatisfadion file t(>ok out of her dear 
 lady Trufty's company was, in reading fome in- 
 ftruftive, or entertaining book, and in the letters 
 . of thofe whom rn'^ knew to be her iincere friends 5 
 but /he had not been much above two months in 
 the Country before file received one from a quar- 
 ter whence (he had not expected it. — It was from 
 -Mr. Trueworth, and contained as follows. 
 
 To Mrs, MuNDEN. 
 
 * Madam, 
 
 *T Have the inexpreffible pleafure to hear, that 
 
 * * you are well, by thofe whom you favour with 
 ' your correfpondence ; but as they may not think 
 
 * any mention of me might be agreeable to you, 
 ' I take the liberty mylelf to acquaint you that 
 
 * I live, and flatter myfelf, that information is fuf- 
 
 * ficient to make you know, that I only live to be, 
 
 * with the molt firm attachment, 
 
 ' Madam, 
 * Your eternally devoted ferrant, 
 
 ' C. Trueworth.^ 
 Thefe few lines affiiring her of his love, and 
 -at the fame time of his refpcft, by his not pre- 
 fuming once to mention the paffion, of which he 
 was poflefled, charmed her to a very high degree, 
 and prepared her heart for another, which in a 
 few weeks after he found a pretence for fending 
 to her J — it contained thele lines. 
 
 To Mrs. Mtjnuem. 
 
 * Madam, 
 
 *T Am now more unhappy than ever j —lady

 ' the tranquility of him, who is with an unfpeak- 
 
 * able regard, 
 
 * Madam, 
 * Your unalterable 
 
 * And devoted fervant, 
 
 * C. Truewor th.' 
 Mrs. Munden found this requeft fo reafonable, 
 
 and withal couched in fuch reipedml terms, that 
 fhe ought not to refufe compliance with it, and 
 accordingly wrote to him in this manner. 
 
 To Charles Trtjeworth, Efq; 
 
 * Sir, 
 
 * '"r^HE generous concern you exprefs for my

 * think kindly of me. I am with all due refpefl, 
 
 * Sir, 
 
 * Yours, Sic. 
 
 ' B. Mutv'DEN.' 
 
 Upon this obliging anfwer he ventured to write 
 again, intreating her to allow a correfpondence 
 with him by letters while fhe remained in L— — e, 
 urging that this was a favour Ihe could not reafon- 
 ab!y deny to any friend, who delired it with the 
 fame fincerity flie muft be convinced he did. 
 
 Mrs. Munden paufed a little, but finding that 
 neither her virtue, nor her reputation could any 
 way fuffer by granting this requefl, her heart 
 
 would 
 

<#PG# 381>
Mifs Betsy Thoughtless, 373 
 
 would not permit her to deny both him and her- 
 felf fo innocent a latisfatflion, and by the next 
 port gave him the permiffion he petitioned for 
 in thele words. 
 
 To Charles Trueworth, Elqj 
 ' Sir, 
 ' 1 Should be unjafl: to myfelf, as well as an- 
 
 * * grateful to the friendfhip with which you ho- 
 
 * nour me, (hould I rejeft any proofs of it that

 * to return :»—» write, therefore as often as you

 * they contain nothing unlliitable to the prefent 
 
 * condition of her, who is, as much as you ought 
 
 * to expefl, Sir, Yours, &c, B, MtrNDEN.' 
 
 After this an i^ninterrupted intercourfe of letters 
 continued between them for tlvs whole remain- 
 der of the year : — Mr. Trueworth was for the 
 mofz part extremely cautious in what manner he 
 expreiTed himfelf, but whenever, as it would 
 fometimes fo happen, the warmth of his paffion 
 made him tranlgrefs the bounds had been pre- 
 fcribed him, flie'would not feem to underftand^ 
 becaufe fhe had no mind to be offended. 
 
 Thus equally maintaining that referve, which 
 /he thought the fituation flie was in demanded, 
 and at the fame time indulgmg the tendernefs of 
 her heart for a man, who i'o well deferved it, fhe 
 enjoyed that fweet contentment, which true Iov« 
 alone has the power of bellowing.

 Mr. Trueworth, who had kept an exafl ac-

 from him Hiould reach her hands the very next 
 day after that, in which fhe was to throw off her 
 mourning weeds;- -it was in thefe terms he 
 now wrote. 
 
 To Mrs. MuNDEN.

 tance of fo many miles, how very dear you are

 Though this was no more than Mr?. Munden 
 had expe^ed, it diffufed thro* her whole frame a 
 glow of latisfaflion, unknown to thofe who do 
 not love as Aie didj— fhe thought indeed, as 
 well as he, that there was now no need of con- 
 tinuing that cruel condrainr, fhe fo long had im- 
 pofed upon herfelf, and hefitated not if ihe Ihould 
 acknowledge what he before had not the leaft 
 cauie to doubt 3 — the terms which flie expref- 
 led herfelf in, were thefe. 
 
 To Charles Truevvorth, Efq; 
 ' Sir, 
 1 Know there is a great fliare of impatience in 
 * the compofirion of your lex, and wonder not 
 at yours : — much lels have I any pretence to ac- 
 cuie you of prerumption, as vou are too well ac- 
 quainted with the juCc lenfiiuhry I have oF your 
 merits not to expei^ all the marks of it that an 
 honourable paffion can require : — an attempt to 
 conceal my heart from you will be in vain ,• — 
 you faw the inmoft recefles of it at a time when 
 you fhould moll have been a llranger there 5 — 
 hut what was then my fiaame to have difcovered, 
 is now my glory to avow; and I Icruple not tQ 
 confels that whatever makes yo :• bappinels 
 will confirm mine : — but I muft ftop here, or 
 when I lee you I /hall have nothing lefr to add, 
 in return for the pains fo long a j lurney will

 way more tedious, but refleft,that every itep will 
 bring you flill nearer to a place vvliere you may 
 be certain of a reception equal to your wifhes, 
 from her, who is with an unfeigned fincerity, 
 
 * Yours, &c. B. MuNUEN.* 
 This was the firft love-letter fhe had ever 
 wrote, and it muft be owned that the paflion f}ie 
 was infpired with, had already made her a pretty 
 good proficient that way ; — but though the 
 prudifh part of the lex may perhaps accufe her of

 baring confefled too much, yet thofe of a mor« 
 realbnable way of thinking, will be far from pro- 
 nouncing fentence againft her j — the perfbn of 
 Mr, Trueworrh, his admirable endowments,— 
 the fervices he had done her, might well warrant 
 the tendernels Hie had for him j — his birth, his 
 ellate, his good charafter, and her own experi^ 
 ?nce of his many virtues, fufficiently authorized 
 her acceptance of his offers ^ and it would have 
 »been only a piece of idle affeflation in her, to 
 have gone about to have concealed her regard for 
 a pcrfon whom fo many reafons induced her to 
 
 many, elpecially as chance had fo long be- 
 
 h>re betrajed to him her inclinations in his favour. 
 Thus fully juftifieci within herlelf, and alTured 
 of being fo hereafter to all her friends, and to 
 ihe world in genera), fhe indulged the moll plea- 
 ding ideas of her approaching happinefs, without 
 5 he leail: luixture of any ot thole inquietudes, 
 U'iiich pride, folly, ill-fortune, or ill humour too 
 hequcftly excite, to poilun all tlie Iwects of love, 
 and imbitter the nKilt tender paffion. 
 
 As fhe had not made lady Trufty the confi- 
 dante of any part of what had paffed between her 
 and Mr. Trueworth, deterred at firll through 
 fhame, and afterwards by the uncertainty of his 
 perfiftmg in his addrefles, that lady would have 
 been greatly furprized at the extraordinary vivaci- 
 ty, which now on a fudden Iparkled in her eyes, 
 if there had not been other motives befides the 
 real one, by which flie might account for it. 
 
 Mrs. Munden had received intelligence, that 
 lady Loveit was fafely delivered of a fon and keir, 
 and what was yet more interefting to her, that Mr. 
 Thoughtlefs was married to a young lady of a 
 large fortune and honourable family 3— —letters 
 alio came from Mr. Francis Thoughtlefs, acquaint- 
 ing them that he had obtained leave ftom his 
 colonel to leave the regiment for two whole 
 
 months,

 roonths, and that after the celebraticm of his bro~ 
 ther's nuptiiis, he wotilcl pall the remiinder of hi* 
 fiirlovv with them in L e. 
 
 Thefe indeed were things wKxch at another time 
 would have highly delighted the mind of Mrs. 
 Munden, but at this, her thoughts were lb ab- 
 forb'd in Mr. Trueworth, whom /lie now every 
 hour expefted, that friendlhip, and even that na- 
 tural affef^ion which had hitherto been lo dilbn- 
 guifhable a part of her charafter, could now boail 
 of but a fecond place. 
 
 Lady Trufty obferving her one day in a more 
 than oidinary chearful humour, took that oppor- 
 tunity of dilcourfing her on a matter, which had 
 been in her head for fome time. — ' Mr. Mun- 
 ' den has been dead a jear,' laid flie 5 ' you have 
 
 * paid all that regard tv) his memory, which could 
 
 * have been expei5led from you, even for a better 
 
 * husbind, and cannot now be bbmed for liften- 
 
 * ing to any offers that may be made to your ad^ 
 
 * vantage.' — ' Offers, madam!' cried Mrs. Mun- 
 den, — * on what Icore does your ladyfhip mean V 
 — — ' what others can you iuppofe,' replied (he 
 gravely, ' than thole of marriage ; — there are two 
 ' gentlemen who have folicited bo:h fir Ralph and 
 
 * myfelf, to u(c our intereit with you in their be- 
 
 * half, neither of them are unworthy your conll- 
 ' deration ;— the one is Mr. Woodland, whom you 
 ' have frequently feen here, his eltate at prefenr, 
 
 * indeed, is no more tkan eight hundred pound a 
 ' year, but he has great expedations from a rich 
 ' uncle the other is our vicar, who befides two 
 
 * large benefices, has lately had a windfall of near 
 ' a thoui-ind pounds a year, by the death of his el- 
 
 * der brother, and it is the opinion of moft people, 
 ' that he will be m tde a bidiop on the firlt vacancy.' 
 
 ,' So much the worfe, madam,' laid the fpiritu- 
 cus Mrs. Mundcn j ' for if he ta.kes the due care he 
 
 * ought to do of his diocels, he will have little 
 
 Iv k q ' time 
 

<#PG# 386>
378 The HISTORY of 
 
 * time to think of his wife: — as to Mr. Wood- 
 ' land, indeed, I have but one objeilion to make, 
 
 * but that is a main one ; — I do not like him, and 
 
 * am well afiured I never can : — I therefore beg 
 
 * your ladyfhip,' continued ihe with an air both 
 fcrious and difdainful, * to advife them to defift 
 
 * all thoughts of me, on the account you mention, 
 
 ' and to let them know I did not come to L e 
 
 ' to get a husband, but to avoid ail impertinent 
 
 * propofals of that kind,' 
 
 * It is not in L — e,' replied lady Trufty, a little 
 piqued at thefe laft words, * but in London you arc 
 ' to expe£t propofals, deferving this contempt ; — 
 
 * here are no falfe gloffes to deceive or impofe on 
 
 * the underftanding ; — here are no pretenders to 
 
 * birth, or to eftate, every one is known for what 
 
 * he really is, and none will prefume to make his 
 ' addrefles to a woman without a confcioufnefs of 
 
 * being qualified to receive the approbation of her 
 
 * friends. 
 
 * I will not difpute with your ladyfhip in this 
 
 * point, replied Mrs. Munden, I grant there 
 
 ' is lefs artifice in the country than the town, 
 ' and fhould fcarce make choice of a man that has 
 
 * been bred, and chufes to refide always in the 
 'latter-; but, madam, it is not the place of 
 
 * nativity, nor the birth, nor the eftate, — but 
 
 * the pcrfon, and the temper of the man can make 
 
 * aie truly happy ; ■ - I (hall always pay a juft 
 
 * regard to the advice of my friends, and particu- 
 ' larly to your hdyfliip ; but as I have been once 
 
 * a facrifice to their perfuafions, I hope you will 
 "*• have the goodnefs to forgive me, v/hen I fay, 
 ' that if ever I become a wife again, love, an in- 
 
 * finity of love, (hall be the chief inducement.' 
 
 • * On whofe fiJe ?' cried lady Trufly haftily ; 
 
 * On both, I hope, madam,' replied Mrs. Mun- 
 den v/ith a fmile : * Take care, my dear,' 
 
 rejoined the oiber, * for if you iliC'uld find your- 
 
 * fclf 
 

<#PG# 387>
Mifs Betsy Thoughtless, 379 
 
 ' felf deceived in that of the man, your own 
 
 * would only ferve to render you the more unhap- 
 
 * py.' 
 
 The fair widow was about to make forre an- 
 fwer, which perhaps would have let lady Trufly 
 into the whole fecret of her heart, if the conver- 
 fation had not been broke off by a very loud ring- 
 ing of the bell at the great gate of the court yard 
 before the houfe, on which, as it v/as natural for 
 them, they both ran to the window to fee what 
 company were coming. 
 
 The firft objed that prcfented itfelf to them, 
 was a very neat running footman, who on the 
 gate being opened, came tripping up towards the 
 houfe, and was immediately followed by a coach 
 with one gentleman in it, drawn by fix prancinf^ 
 horfes, and attended by two fervants in rich live- 
 ries, and well mounted; ladyTrufly was fome- 
 what furprifed, as fhe never had feen either the 
 pcrfon in the coach, or the equipage before, but 
 infinitely more fo when Mrs. Munden Parting 
 from the window, in the greateft confufion ima- 
 ginable, cried, --- ' Madam, with your leave, 
 
 * -— I will fpeak to him in the parlour.' 
 
 * Speak to whom?' faid lady Trufty : The 
 
 other had not the power to anfwer, and was run- 
 ning out of the room, when a fervant of fir 
 Ralph's came up to tell her, a gentleman, who 
 called himfelf Trueworth, v^as come to wait on 
 her. ' I know 1 know,' cried fhe, * con- 
 
 * 6\idi him into the parlour.' 
 
 Prepared as (he was by the expc£^2tion of his 
 arrival, all her prefence of mind was not fuffici- 
 cnt to enable her to ftand the fudden rufh of joy, 
 which on fijht of him burfl in upon her heart ; --- 
 
 nor was Ive'lcfs overcome, ite fprang into her 
 
 arn^i'^, which of themfeh'es opened to receive him, 
 and while he killed away the tears that trickled 
 from her eves, his own bedewed her cheeks. — '— 
 
 ' Oh

 ' Oh have I lived to fee you thus !' — cried he, 
 * thus ravifftingly kind!' ' And have I 
 
 * lived,' rejoined (he, * to receive thofe proofs of 
 ' afFe£tion from the heft and moft ill ufed of men ; 
 
 * --- Oh Trueworth! Trueworth ! added {he, 
 
 * I have not merited this from you.'----* You me- 
 ' rit all things,' --- faid he, ' let us talk no more 
 ' of what is paft, but tell me that you now are 
 
 * mine ; •-- I came to make you fo by the irrevo- 
 
 * cable ties of love and- law, and we muft now 
 
 * part no more ! --- Speak my angel, --- my firft, 
 ' my laft charmer,' continued he, perceiving {he 
 was filent, blufhed, and hung down her head j --- 
 ' let thofe dear lips confirm my happinefs, and 
 
 * fay the time is come, that you will be all mine.* 
 The trembling fair now having gathered a little 
 more afTurancc, raifed her eyes from the earth, 
 and looking tenderly on him, --- ' you know you 
 
 * have my heart, cried {he, and cannot doubt my 
 
 * hand.' 
 
 After this a confiderable time was paft in all 
 thofs mutual endearments, which honour and mo- 
 defty would permit, without Mrs. Munden's once 
 remembering the obligations fhe was under of re- 
 lieving lady Trufly from the confternation fhe had 
 left hsr in. • 
 
 'I'hat hdy had indeed heard her fervant fay who 
 was below, but as Mrs. Munden had never men- 
 tioned the name of Mr. Trueworth the whole 
 time fhe had been with her, and had not any fuf- 
 picion of the correfpondence between them, much 
 Icfb could have the leaft notion of her afFciftion for 
 a gentleman, whom fhe had once refufed, in fpite 
 of the many advantages an alliance with him of- 
 fered, nothing could be more aftonifliing to her 
 than this vifit, and the diforder with which Mrs. 
 Munden went down to receive it. 
 
 She was dUi ruminating on an event, which 
 appeared fo extraordinary to her, when the now 
 
 happy

 happy lovers entered the room, and difcovered by 
 their countenances, feme part of what flie wifted 
 to know ;•— - * I beg leave, madam,' faid Mrs. 
 Munden, ' to introduce to your ladyfhip, a gen- 
 
 * tleman whofe name and charafler you are not 
 •unacquainted with, Mr. Trueworth. 
 
 ' I am, indeed, no ftranger to bothj' replied 
 lady Trufty, advancing to receive him, * nor to 
 *^ the refpeil: they claim :' he returned this compli- 
 ment with a politenefs which was natural to him, 
 and after they were feated, her ladyftiip beginning 
 to exprefs the fatisfadtion (he felt in feeing; a gen- 
 tleman of whofe amiable qualities fhe had fo high 
 
 an idea ; * Your ladyfhip does me too much 
 
 ' honour,* faid he, * but I fear you will repent 
 
 * this goodnefs, when you (hall find I am come 
 
 * with an intent to rob you of a companion, who 
 
 * I know is very dear to you.' 
 
 * If you (hould fucceed in the robbery you men- 
 
 * tion,' anfwered (he fmiling, * you will make me 
 
 * ample attonement for it by the pieafure you vpili 
 ' give me in knowing what I have loft is in flich

 Mr. Trueworth had no time to make any reply 
 to thefe obliging words, fir Ralph who had dined 
 abroad, came in that inftant, not a little furprized 
 to find fo gay an equipage, and altogether unkiiown 
 to him, before his door, but on his lady's acquaint- 
 ing him with the name of their new guefl-, wel- 
 comed him with a complaifance not at all inferior to 
 what (he had (hewn. — There requires little cere- 
 mony between perfons of true breeding to enter 
 into a freedom of converfation, and the good old 
 baronet was beginning to entertain Mr. Trueworth 
 with fome difcourfe?, which at another time would 
 have been very agreeable to him, but that obedient

 delayed the performance no longer than wasneccf- 
 fary to do it without abruptnefs. 
 
 Mrs. Manden, who in defiring he fliould break 
 the matter, had not meant he fliould do it fo fud- 
 denly, or in her prelence, looked like the fun juft 
 ftarting from a cloud all the time he was fpeaking) 
 and was ready to die with fhame when fir Ralph 
 faid, that fince all things were concluded between 
 chem, and there was no need for farther courtfhip, 
 he could not fee any reafon why their marriage 
 fhould not be immediately compleated : but lady 
 Trufly, in compaflion to her fair friend's confu- 
 fion, oppofed this motion : — the next day after 
 the fucceeding one, was however appointed with- 
 out any fhew of relu£tance on the fide of Mrs, 
 Munden, and the inexpreflible fatisfadtion of Mr. 
 Trueworth. 
 
 He had lain the night before at an inn about 
 eight miles (hort of fir Ralph's feat, and as he had 
 no acquaintance either with him or his lady, had 
 intended to make that his home during his ftay in 
 the country, but fir Ralph and lady Trufty would

 No propofals having yet been made concerning:!. 
 a fettlement for Mrs, Munden,, by way of dowry, 
 Mr. Trueworth took fir Ralph afide the next 
 morning, and defited he would fend for a lawyer, 
 which he immediately did, — a gentleman of that 
 profefTion happening to live very near— and on his 
 coming, received fuch inftru£^ions from Mr, 
 Trueworth for drawing up the writings as con- 
 vinced fir Ralph both of the greatnefs of his gene- 
 rofity, and the fincerity of his love to the lady he 
 was about to make his wife. 
 
 Expedition having been recommended to the law-

 required not the leaft alteration ; — while fir Ralph 
 and Mr. Trueworth v/ere locked up with him in 
 order to examine it, Mrs. Munden received no 
 inconfiderable addition to the prcfent fatisfa£iion 
 of her mind, by the arrival of her brother Frank : 
 after the firft welcome being given, * You are 
 
 * come, captain,' faid lady Trufty, * jufl time 
 
 * enough to be a witnefs of your filter's marriage, 
 ' which is to be celebrated to-morrow.' --- * Mar- 
 
 * riage,' cried he, --- * and without acquainting 
 
 * either of her brothers with her intentions ! --- but 
 ' I hope,' continued he, * it is not todiladvantage, 
 
 * as your ladyfhip feems not difpleafed at it.' -— * I 
 
 * afTure you, captain,' refumed lady Trufty, ' I 
 
 * knew nothing of the affair till yefterday, nor 
 
 * had ever feen before the gentleman your fifter has 
 
 * made choice of, but love and deftiny, added (he, 
 ' are not to be refifted,' Thefe words, and the 
 ferious air fhe affumed in fpeaking them, giving 
 him caufe to fear his fifter was going to throw 
 herfelfaway, helhookhis head, and feemed in a 
 good deal of uneafinefs, but had not opportunity 
 to teftify what he felt, any otherwife than by his 
 looks. --- Sir Ralph and Mr. Trueworth in that 
 
 inftant entered the room ; the extreme fuprize 
 
 he was in at the fight of the latter, was fuch as 
 prevented him from paying his refpedls to either 
 in the manner he would have done, if more mafter 
 of himfelf ; but Mr. Trueworth eafily guefling 
 the emotions of his mind, lock'd him in his arms, 
 faying, -- * Dear Frank, I ftiall at laft be fo happy 
 
 * as to call you brother ;' Heavens, is it pofli- 
 
 * ble! cried he, ' Am I awake? or is this illu- 
 
 * fion !' — - then running to Mrs. Munden, * Sifter,' 
 faid he, ' is what I hear a real h€t ! are you 
 ^ indeed to be married to Mr. Trueworth ?* -— .• 
 
 * You hear I am,' anfwered £he fmiling, * and 
 
 * hear it from a mouth not accuflomed to deceit/ 
 he then flew to Mr, Trueworth, crying, ' My 
 
 * dear,

 ' dear, xJear Trueworth, I little hoped this honour ;' 
 then turning to Udy Tru0y, -•- * Oh madanij 
 ' faid he, how agreeably have you recceiyed me T 
 
 * I knew it would be fo,' — replied .fije, * yet I told 
 ' nothing but the truth. 
 
 The extravagance of the young captain's joy 
 being a little over, Mr. Trueworth: prefenied Mrs. 
 Munden with the parchment he had received frooi 
 the lawyer, — « What is this ?' demanded (he ; — :- 
 
 * Take it, take it,' cried fir Ralph, * it is no lefs 
 ' than a fettlement of eight hundred pounds a yea,r 
 
 * to you, in cafe of accidents.' * I accept it, fir,' 
 
 Taid Mrs. Munden to Mr Trueworth, ' as a frefh 
 
 * proof of your afFe£lion, but heaven forbid I {houl.d 
 ' ever live to receive any other advantage fron» 
 
 * it.'—- He kifTed her hand with the moft tendqi: 
 tranfportson thefe obliging words; —-after whicll, 
 they all feated themfelves, and never was there g 
 joy more perfedl and fincere than what eaqh of this 
 worthy company gave demonftrations of in their 
 refped^ive charaders. The next morning com- 
 pleated the wifhes of the enamoured pair, and th^ 
 faiisfadtion of their friends. 
 
 An account of this event was difpatched the 
 next poft to all, who had any v/elfarc in the in- 
 tereft of the new v/edded lovers : Mr. Thoughtlefs, 
 tho' very much engrofled by his own happinefs, 
 could not but rejoice in the good fortune of his 
 fifter : -— fir Bazil, vi^hofince his thorough know- 
 ledge of Mrs. Mur:den, had a high efteem for her, 
 was extremely glad, but his lady was warm even 
 to an excefs in her congratulations : in fine, there 
 were few of her acquaintance who did not in fome 
 meafure take part in their felicity. 
 
 Thus were the virtues of our heroine, (thofe 
 follies that had defaced them being fully corrctSied) 
 at length rewarded with a happinefs, retarded only 
 till (lie had render'd herfelf wholly worthy of r-e-s 
 ceiving it,
